	8/14/2008--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since the Conference Report was filed in the House on July 30, 2008. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Higher Education Opportunity Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize HEA programs. Title I: General Provisions - (Sec. 101) Revises the general definition of an institution of higher education (IHE) to include schools that: (1) admit students whose secondary education was conducted in a home school setting; (2) award degrees (not necessarily bachelor's degrees) that are acceptable for admission to a graduate or professional degree program; and (3) enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 102) Revises the definition of an IHE for purposes of title IV student assistance programs. Requires graduate medical schools located outside the country, that qualified to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program owing to their having a state-approved clinical training program as of January 1, 1992, to have continuously operated a clinical training program in at least one state that is approved by such state. Allows foreign nursing schools to participate in the FFEL program if : (1) they have agreements with hospitals or nursing schools located in this country that require students to complete their training at such hospitals and schools, and such schools to provide graduates with their degrees; (2) they certify only subsidized Stafford loans and unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS loans under the FFEL program; (3) they agree to reimburse the Secretary of Education (Secretary) for the cost of any student loan defaults included in their cohort default rates; and (4) at least 75% of their students or graduates who take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses pass such exam. Directs the advisory panel of medical experts to report to the Secretary and Congress, within one year of this Act's enactment, its recommendations for alternate eligibility requirements allowing foreign graduate medical schools with a clinical training program approved by a state before 2008 to participate in the FFEL program. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations establishing such alternate eligibility criteria. Raises from 60% to 75% the pass rate required of foreign graduate medical schools on examinations administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates if such schools are to participate in the FFEL program. Includes as proprietary IHEs any schools offering baccalaureate degrees in liberal arts and schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. Includes as postsecondary vocational institutions any schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 103) Adds definitions of critical foreign language, distance education, diploma mill, early childhood education program, poverty line, universal design, and universal design for learning. (Sec. 104) Elaborates on the current sense of Congress regarding the speech and association rights of students in higher education to specify that such students should not be intimidated, harassed, discouraged from speaking out, or discriminated against. (Sec. 106) Reconstitutes the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in the Department of Education (Department) to advise the Secretary on accreditation matters until October 2014. (Sec. 107) Requires biennial IHE reviews of their alcohol and drug abuse prevention programs to include a determination as to: (1) the number of drug- and alcohol-related violations and fatalities occurring on the campus or as part of their activities that are reported to campus officials; and (2) the number and type of sanctions the IHEs impose on students or employees as a result of such violations or fatalities. Repeals the National Recognition Awards for outstanding IHE alcohol and drug abuse prevention programs. Reauthorizes appropriations for alcohol and drug abuse prevention grants for FY2009-FY2014.

Requires IHEs on the lists for the largest percentage increases in tuition and fees or net price over the most recent three years to issue reports to the Secretary explaining such increases, the steps they will take toward reducing costs, and the extent to which their state governments are responsible for such cost increases. Requires the Secretary to summarize such reports in a report to be provided to Congress and placed on the College Navigator website. Requires the Secretary to report annually on the College Navigator website comparisons for each state of percentage changes over the most recent five years in: (1) state spending per full-time student in public IHEs; (2) the tuition and fees such students have been charged over the most recent five years; and (3) the total amount of state need- and merit-based aid provided to such students.
