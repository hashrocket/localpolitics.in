Recognizes the independence of Israel as a significant event for providing refuge and a national homeland for the Jewish people. Supports efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. Commends the bipartisan commitment of all Presidents and Congresses of the United States since 1948 that supported Israel and worked for its security and well-being. Congratulates the United States and Israel for strengthening their bilateral relations during 2006 in the fields of defense, diplomacy, and homeland security, and encourages both countries to continue their cooperation. Extends the best wishes of the Senate to the people of Israel as they celebrate the 59th anniversary of Israel's independence.<br/>
