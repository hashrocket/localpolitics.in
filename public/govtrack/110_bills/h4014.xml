	10/31/2007--Introduced.<br/>Insurance Non-Discrimination for Survivors Act - Prohibits an insurer from denying or terminating an insurance policy or health benefit plan, restricting or excluding coverage for losses or denying a claim, or adding a premium differential to any policy or health benefit plan on the basis that the insured (or any employee or any person with whom the insured is known to have a relationship or association) is the subject of, or incurs a claim related to, domestic abuse. Prohibits: (1) an insurer from denying or limiting payment to an insured who is the subject of abuse if the claim for payment is a result of the abuse; (2) an insurer or health carrier from terminating health coverage for a subject of abuse because coverage was originally issued in the name of the abuser and the abuser has divorced, separated from, or lost custody of the subject or the abuser's coverage has terminated and the subject does not qualify for an extension of coverage; and (3) any person employed by or contracting with an insurer or health benefit plan to use, disclose, or transfer specified information (including regarding abuse status) without the subject's consent. Requires: (1) insurers to develop and adhere to written policies specifying procedures to be followed to protect the safety and privacy of a subject of abuse; and (2) an insurer that takes an action that adversely affects a subject of abuse to advise that applicant or insured in writing of the specific reasons for the action.<br/>
