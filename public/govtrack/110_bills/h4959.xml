	1/15/2008--Introduced.<br/>Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act of 2008 - Directs the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and any other necessary representative of the executive branch of the U.S. government to begin consultations with the appropriate congressional committees and leadership on any potential long-term security, economic, or political agreement (agreement) with the government of Iraq. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) full Iraqi sovereignty is in the U.S. national interest; and (2) any agreement that is not in the form of a treaty with respect to which the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification under Article II of the Constitution of the United States does not have the force and effect of law. Prohibits obligating or expending funds for the implementation of any agreement with the government of Iraq unless the agreement is in the form of a treaty with respect to which the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification under Article II.<br/>
