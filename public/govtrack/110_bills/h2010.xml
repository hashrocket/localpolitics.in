Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to designate a zone around a facility in which incompatible installations, structures, or uses are prohibited. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, for permits for facilities in certain areas subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the consent of lessees, operators, and owners. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) establish and conduct an integrated, multidisciplinary, scientific research and development program to further marine aquaculture technologies that are compatible with the protection of marine ecosystems; and (2) conduct research and development in partnership with permit holders.
