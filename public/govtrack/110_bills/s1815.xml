	7/18/2007--Introduced.<br/>All-Terrain Vehicle Standards and Compliance Act of 2007 - Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to issue a consumer product safety standard for all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) that is, subject to exception, identical to a specified publication by the American National Standards Institute/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America. Makes specified provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act and other federal law inapplicable to that issuance. Applies the standard to ATVs manufactured or imported after the standard is published. Allows ATVs that comply with the standard to incorporate characteristics or components not covered by the standard. Requires each ATV manufacturer or importer to submit an action plan to the CPSC for approval and to comply with an approved plan. Prohibits the importation or distribution of three-wheeled ATVs until a mandatory consumer product safety standard applicable to such vehicles is in effect. Requires each ATV to which the standard applies to bear a label certifying compliance.
