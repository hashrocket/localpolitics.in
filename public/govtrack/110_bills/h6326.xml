	6/19/2008--Introduced.<br/>Military Family Support Act of 2008 - Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a program to authorize a caregiver (a federal employee at least 18 years of age capable of providing care to a child or other dependent family member of a member of the Armed Forces) to use: (1) any available sick leave for the provision of such care in the same manner as annual leave is used; and (2) any federal leave available to that caregiver as though that period of caregiving is a medical emergency.<br/>Requires the program to: (1) provide a process for reasonable notice of the need for leave; and (2) protect employees from discrimination or retaliation for the use of leave under this Act and provide the opportunity to appeal a denial of its use. Requires the service member for whom the caregiving is provided to be performing service in support of a contingency operation or in situations for which hostile fire or imminent danger pay is authorized and to designate the caregiver for his or her family.<br/>Terminates the program on December 31, 2012.<br/>Provides for an offsetting reduction in FY2008 appropriations for the Department of Defense for research, development, test and evaluation.<br/>
