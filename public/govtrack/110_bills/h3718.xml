	10/2/2007--Introduced.<br/>Educational Advisor and Contractor Integrity Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require the Secretary of Education to establish a screening process to address conflicts of interest on the part of individuals being considered for service on advisory committees used in the Act's administration. Authorizes the Secretary to grant an exemption to individuals that have a conflict of interest if: (1) the conflict does not compromise the integrity, in fact or appearance, of the committee's efforts; (2) the conflict can be sufficiently mitigated; and (3) reasonable efforts were made to identify alternate conflict-free individuals. Considers such advisory committee members to be special government employees for purposes of the federal criminal code. Directs the Secretary to: (1) work with the Office of Government Ethics to develop policies and procedures to address conflicts of interest on the part of advisory committee members, including the adoption of an alternative confidential financial disclosure form for such members; and (2) seek advice, before convening an advisory group, from the Committee Management Secretariat within the General Services Administration (GSA) as to the applicability of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Requires the Secretary to screen potential providers of technical assistance under the Act for conflicts of interest and implement a process for continually monitoring whether technical assistance providers are appropriately implementing required conflicts of interest policies and procedures.<br/>
