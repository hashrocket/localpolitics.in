	<summary>
	8/3/2007--Introduced.<br/>Requires an air carrier that furloughs an airline employee to retain such employee on a recall list for not less than 10 years after the furlough, provided the air carrier: (1) receives more than $100 million in federal assistance; and (2) places such employee on furlough not later than two years after receiving such assistance. Requires such air carrier, before employing a person who is not on the recall list, to recall an employee from the recall list if such employee was employed in a position comparable to the position the air carrier seeks to fill. Authorizes a furloughed employee (including any labor organization that represents such employee) to bring an action in U.S. district court to enforce this Act.<br/>
