	3/27/2007--Introduced.<br/>Pediatric Research Improvement Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to direct an applicant seeking to waive submission requirements related to pediatric assessments of the safety and effectiveness of a drug or biological product to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services documentation detailing why a pediatric formulation cannot be developed. Requires an applicant seeking to defer submission of some or all of such assessments to submit to the Secretary a timeline for the completion of pediatric studies.<br/>Requires the Secretary to create an internal committee to review pediatric assessment requests issued, pediatric assessments conducted, and deferral and waiver requests. Considers a supplement to a new drug or biological license application proposing a labeling change as a result of any pediatric assessments to be a priority supplement. Sets forth dispute resolution procedures for labeling changes for pediatric drugs.<br/>Requires the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make available to the public the medical, statistical, and clinical pharmacology reviews of pediatric assessments.<br/>Requires the Secretary to: (1) require sponsors of the assessments that result in labeling changes to distribute such information to physicians and other health care providers; (2) ensure that all adverse event reports that have been received for such a drug are referred to the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics for one year after a labeling change; and (3) contract with the Institute of Medicine to study and report to Congress regarding the pediatric studies conducted pursuant to FFDCA since 1997.<br/>Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the effectiveness of FFDCA provisions relating to pediatric studies in ensuring that medicines used by children are tested and properly labeled.<br/>
