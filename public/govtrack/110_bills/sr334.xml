	9/27/2007--Introduced.<br/>Calls the world's attention to the serious degradation of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea. Applauds the cooperative manner with which the governments of Israel and Jordan, as well as the Palestinian Authority (PA) have worked to address the declining water level and quality of the Dead Sea and other water-related challenges in the region. Expresses hopes that the spirit of cooperation manifested in the search for a solution to the Dead Sea water crisis might serve as a model for addressing the degradation of the Jordan River, as well as a model of peace and cooperation for the upcoming meetings in Washington between Israel and the PA.
