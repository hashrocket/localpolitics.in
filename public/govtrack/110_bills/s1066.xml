	3/29/2007--Introduced.<br/>Medical Education Affordability Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to revise specified regulations regarding student loan repayment deferment under certain programs of the Higher Education Act of 1965 with respect to borrowers who qualify for such deferment on the basis of economic hardship and are in postgraduate medical or dental internship, residency, or fellowship programs.
