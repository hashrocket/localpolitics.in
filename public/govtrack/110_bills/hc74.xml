	2/27/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Commends the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for working with leading scientists and researchers to organize the first-ever NIH conference on hydrocephalus (a neurological condition characterized by the abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluids in the ventricles of the brain). Urges the Director to continue the current collaboration with respect to hydrocephalus among national research institutes. Calls for: (1) further research into the epidemiology, pathophysiology, disease burden, and improved treatment of hydrocephalus; and (2) increased public awareness and professional education regarding hydrocephalus through partnerships between the federal government and patient advocacy organizations, such as the Hydrocephalus Association.<br/>
