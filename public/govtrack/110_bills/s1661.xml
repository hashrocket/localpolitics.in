Establishes in the Treasury the Travel Promotion Fund. Provides matching funds requirements. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to develop and implement a fully automated electronic travel authorization system to collect basic biographical information necessary to determine, in advance of travel, the eligibility of an alien to travel to the United States under the visa waiver program. Authorizes the Secretary to charge a fee for the system's use. Requires the Secretary to: (1) prescribe regulations that provide a period, not to exceed three years, during which a determination of eligibility to travel under visa waiver program will be valid; and (2) report to Congress on program implementation. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the Corporation to impose an annual assessment on U.S. members of the international travel and tourism industry represented on the Board of Directors of the Corporation, provided such assessment is approved by a majority of industry members in a referendum. (Sec. 7) Establishes in the Department of Commerce the Office of Travel Promotion, headed by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Travel Promotion, to conduct various activities related to the promotion of international travel to the United States. Requires periodic reports from the Under Secretary to the congressional commerce committees.
