	<summary>
	1/9/2007--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) after more than 3,000 American casualties, over $300 billion in expenditures, and almost four years of fighting, an increase in the number of members of the U.S. Armed Forces deployed in Iraq is the wrong course of action and should not be done without an express authorization for the increase in an Act of Congress; and (2) a drastic shift in U.S. political and diplomatic strategy, as well as the mission of the U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq, is needed to secure and stabilize Iraq so that a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops can begin as soon as possible.
