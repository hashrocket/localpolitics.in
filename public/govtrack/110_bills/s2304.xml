The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2008 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to extend through 2014 the authorization of appropriations for the adult and juvenile mental health collaboration grant program. Includes within the priorities for awarding grants under such program the identification and treatment of mentally-ill offenders and the expanded use of mental health courts.<br/>Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to states, local governments, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations to: (1) offer law enforcement officers and campus security personnel training to respond appropriately to incidents involving mentally-ill individuals; (2) establish specialized receiving centers to assess the mental health requirements and suicide risk of individuals in law enforcement custody; (3) provide computerized information systems to improve the response of law enforcement and criminal justice personnel to mentally-ill offenders; and (4) establish cooperative programs to promote public safety by using effective intervention for mentally-ill offenders. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to develop training models for law enforcement personnel for responding to the needs of individuals with mental illnesses, including suicide prevention.
