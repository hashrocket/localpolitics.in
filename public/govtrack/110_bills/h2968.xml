	7/10/2007--Introduced.<br/>Summer Food Service Rural Expansion Act - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act with respect to the summer food service programs for children in service institutions (e.g., schools and summer camps).<br/>Revises the condition limiting eligibility to institutions conducting a regularly scheduled food service for children from areas in which poor economic conditions exist (i.e., where at least 50% of the children meet eligiblity requirements for certain free or reduced price school meals.)<br/>Eliminates the special 2005 and 2006 exemption from this requirement for rural areas in Pennsylvania which lowers the threshold eligibility to areas where at least 40% of the children meet eligiblity requirements for free or reduced price school meals.<br/>Applies such 40% threshold to rural areas of all states and makes it permanent.<br/>
