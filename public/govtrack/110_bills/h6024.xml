Directs the Secretary: (1) in developing that list, to prioritize the projects recommended for implementation based on consideration of specified factors, including the extent of disrepair, economic and cultural impacts, and overall benefits of the project to efficient water operations; and (2) to notify each Rio Grande Pueblo in writing, inviting the Pueblo to consult with the Secretary regarding the study if it notifies the Secretary in writing of such intent within three months after receiving notice.<br/>Authorizes the Secretary (subject to specified limitations) to provide grants to the Pueblos to plan, design, construct, or otherwise implement recommended projects to repair, rehabilitate, reconstruct, or replace Pueblo irrigation infrastructure to: (1) increase water use efficiency and agricultural productivity for the benefit of a Pueblo; (2) conserve water; or (3) otherwise enhance water management or help avert water supply conflicts in the Rio Grande Basin.<br/>Sets the federal share of the project's cost at 75%, with an exception based on financial hardship.
