	5/10/2007--Introduced.<br/>Responsibility to Iraqi Refugees Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide special immigrant status to an Iraqi national (and spouse or child of such alien) who: (1) worked directly with the U.S. government, the United Nations, certified government or U.N. contractor or subcontractor, or U.S.-based nongovernmental organization for at least one year; and (2) has a not manifestly unfounded fear of persecution, violence, or harm to the alien or the alien's family because of such work. Sets forth annual entry limits through FY2011 for such aliens. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) provide such aliens who are in imminent danger with protection, including temporary housing on U.S. military bases or at provincial reconstruction team offices or immediate removal from Iraq; and (2) establish at least five alien processing facilities in Iraq. Establishes in the Department of State a Special Coordinator for Iraqi Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, to be based at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. States that the Special Coordinator shall be responsible for the development and implementation of policies and programs for Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons, and shall establish a related inter-agency task force. Directs the Secretary of State to seek to negotiate a bilateral refugee resettlement agreement with each country containing a significant population of displaced Iraqis, including Jordan, Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Increases FY2007-FY2008 refugee admissions for persons who are not not firmly settled in a foreign country and who are of humanitarian concern to the United States in order to admit Iraqi refugees. Sets forth priority groups. Revises the authority of the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine that security and related grounds for inadmissibility shall not apply to an individual or a group. Waives the FY2008-FY2009 funding cap for the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund. Authorizes appropriations to specified entities and agencies for Iraqi refugee-related assistance.<br/>
