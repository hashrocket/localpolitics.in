	2/14/2007--Introduced.<br/>States that Congress disagrees with the plan announced by the President on January 10, 2007, to increase by more than 20,000 the number of U.S. combat troops in Iraq and urges the President to consider the options set forth in this resolution. States that Congress believes that: (1) the military rules of engagement must allow maximum opportunity for U.S. and coalition forces to pursue the enemy in Iraq; (2) U.S. Armed Forces fighting insurgents and al Qaida terrorists in Al Anbar Province need to be reinforced as determined by military commanders; (3) the Iraq reconstruction effort must focus on projects with a small security footprint; (4) one person in Iraq must have absolute authority and responsibility for reconstruction funding; (5) the United States and its Middle Eastern allies should develop an Iraqi repatriation program; (6) terrorism has been fueled by staggering unemployment rates in Iraq and that the United States with its allies should develop an economic development plan for Baghdad and Al Anbar Province; and (7) the U.S. government should develop a program to open and revitalize the several hundred shuttered state-owned enterprises in Iraq with primary focus on Baghdad and Al Anbar Province.
