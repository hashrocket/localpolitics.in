	6/25/2008--Introduced.<br/>Commodity Futures Restoration Act - Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to remove &quot;energy commodity&quot; from the category of exempt commodities (thus bringing &quot;energy commodity&quot; within the purview of the Act and extending the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to derivatives and swaps involving energy commodities). Declares that a board of trade, exchange, or market shall not be considered to be foreign or located outside the United States if: (1) it has an affiliate located in the United States; or (2) a contract of sale of a commodity, or a significant price discovery contract, is executed or traded on such board of trade, exchange, or market.
