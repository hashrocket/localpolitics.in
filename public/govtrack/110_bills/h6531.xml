	7/22/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Vessel Hull Design Protection Amendments of 2008 - Amends federal copyright law to specify that the design of a vessel's hull, deck, or combination of a hull and deck, including a plug or mold are protected (currently, only the design of the vessel hull is protected, including a plug or mold). Requires that Department of Defense (DOD) rights in a registered design, including the right to build to such a design, be determined solely by provisions of federal Armed Forces law relating to rights in technical data or by the instrument under which the design was developed for the U.S. government. Redefines &quot;useful article&quot; and &quot;hull.&quot; Defines &quot;deck&quot; as the horizontal surface of the vessel that covers the hull, including exterior cabin and cockpit surfaces, and exclusive of masts, sails, yards, rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.<br/>
