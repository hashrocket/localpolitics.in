	2/14/2008--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the U.S. government and the governments of other industrial countries should: (1) work toward the accelerated removal of agricultural barriers in industrialized countries in order to promote African economic growth; and (2) work with the governments of least developed African countries to build trade capacity to minimize the economic impact of an opening of African markets to foreign goods.
