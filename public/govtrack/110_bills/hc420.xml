	9/18/2008--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) stagnant wages, declining access to employer-sponsored health care and pensions, and the rising cost of living all contribute to greater financial insecurity for the average American worker; (2) the Social Security Act provides the essential basic social safety net for American workers and their families, and it should be improved and expanded upon to meet the needs of the 21st century American workforce; and (3) in addition to responding to the needs of American workers and their families when they experience unemployment and face hardship, the federal government should pursue enactment of policies that proactively enable workers to improve their skills throughout their careers to ensure these workers, and the businesses that rely upon them, are as globally competititve as possible.
