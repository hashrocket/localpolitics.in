	7/30/2007--Introduced.<br/>New Opportunities for Fuel Efficient Fleets Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 regarding mandatory state fleet programs to consider a hybrid motor vehicle to be an alternative fueled vehicle when acquired by a state if publicly available fueling facilities that dispense E85 fuel are not convenient or accessible in the state. Defines a hybrid motor vehicle as one that achieves at least: (1) 25% better fuel economy ratings than comparable gasoline fueled vehicles; or (2) 10% better fuel economy ratings than comparable gasoline fueled vehicles, and is determined by the Secretary of Energy to be appropriate for consideration as an alternative fueled vehicle on the basis of improved emissions, availability, or technological innovation.<br/>
