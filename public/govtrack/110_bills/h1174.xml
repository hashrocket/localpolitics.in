	2/16/2007--Introduced.<br/>Healthy Hospitals Act of 2007 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require public reporting of health care-associated infections data by hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program under Medicare to provide financial incentives or grants to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers that demonstrate a satisfactory reduction in the rate of occurrence (or elimination) of health care-associated infections in the applicable hospital or ambulatory surgical center. Expresses the sense of Congress that health care providers and facilities should take measures to reduce the rate of occurrence of health care-associated infections to zero, with respect to patients to whom such providers and facilities furnish services.
