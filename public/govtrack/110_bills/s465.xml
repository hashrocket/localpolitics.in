	1/31/2007--Introduced.<br/>Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to provide for Medicare coverage of end-of-life planning and consultations as part of an initial preventive physical examination. Requires a service provider, Medicare Advantage organization, or prepaid or eligible organization to give effect to an advance directive executed outside the state in which it is presented, even one that does not appear to meet the formalities of execution, form, or language required by the state in which it is presented, to the same extent as such provider or organization would give effect to an advanced directive that meets such requirements. Permits a provider or organization to decline to honor such a directive if it can be reasonably demonstrated that it is not an authentic expression of the individual's wishes concerning his or her health care. Makes such advance directive requirements applicable under SSA title XIX (Medicaid). Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, directly or through grants, to: (1) conduct a national education campaign to raise public awareness of the importance of planning for care near the end of life; and (2) provide for a national, toll-free information clearinghouse, as well as clearinghouses that the public may access to find out about state-specific information regarding advance directives and end-of-life decisions. Requires the General Accounting Office to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of a national registry for advanced directives.
