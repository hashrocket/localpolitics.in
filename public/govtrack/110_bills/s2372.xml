	11/15/2007--Introduced.<br/>Affordable Footwear Act of 2007 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the elimination of duty on certain imported footwear would provide significant benefit to U.S. consumers, particularly lower-income families. Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to provide for the duty-free treatment of certain footwear (including children's shoes) made of rubber or plastics that are imported into the United States. Amends the Caribbean Basic Economic Recovery Act to provide footwear imported directly from Haiti into the United States with the same preferential treatment that is provided to certain imported footwear under the Dominican Republic-Central American-United States Free Trade Agreement.<br/>
