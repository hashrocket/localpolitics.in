	8/13/2007--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on July 30, 2007. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Allows, subject to the provisions of this Act, the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan to transfer, lease, encumber, or otherwise convey, without further authorization or approval, all or any part of the Tribe's interest in any real property that is not held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe. Prohibits anything in this Act from intending to authorize the Tribe to transfer, lease, encumber, or otherwise convey, any lands, or any interest in any lands, that are held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe. Bars the United States from being held liable to any party (including the Tribe or any agent or instrumentality of the Tribe) for any term of, or any loss resulting from the term of any transfer, lease, encumbrance, or conveyance of land pursuant to this Act, except as specified. Makes such prohibition nonapplicable to land transferred or conveyed by the Tribe to the United States to be held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe.<br/>
