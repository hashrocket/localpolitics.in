	1/17/2007--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States should be committed to a strong relationship with a democratic Serbia as Serbia moves toward its goals of membership in the European Union (EU) and cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO); (2) the inclusion of Serbia in the NATO Partnership for Peace Program was a critical step in bringing Serbia closer to the Euro-Atlantic Alliance; (3) Serbia will now have the opportunity to enact defense reforms and apply for a Membership Action Plan for NATO; (4) Serbia should continue its reform progress; (5) Serbia should move quickly to fulfill its obligations to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, including by immediately arresting Ratko Mladic and transferring him to the Hague; and (6) the United States should continue its defense and security cooperation with Serbia, and should remain a friend to the people of Serbia as they continue on the path of democracy.
