Directs the Administrator, in allocating funds among metropolitan areas applying for such grants to consider specified factors, such as the relative threat, vulnerability, and consequences faced by the eligible metropolitan area from a terrorist attack and the anticipated effectiveness of the proposed spending plan for the eligible metropolitan area in increasing that area's ability to prevent, prepare for, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorism, to meet its target capabilities and to otherwise reduce the overall risk. Requires the Administrator to distribute grant funds to the states in which an approved eligible metropolitan area is located. Requires each state to provide the eligible metropolitan area at least 80% of grant funds and an accounting of the items or services on which any funds retained by the state were expended.

Places upon the Administrator responsibility for administering all DHS-administered homeland security grant programs and for ensuring coordination and consistency. Requires any state or metropolitan area receiving grants to establish a planning committee to assist in preparing and revising state, regional, or local homeland security plans and in determining effective funding priorities (with an exception where the state or metropolitan area has established and uses a multijurisdictional planning committee or commission that meets specified requirements).<br/>Directs the Secretary, through the Administrator, to: (1) compile a comprehensive list of federal programs that provide assistance to state, local, and tribal governments for preventing, preparing for, and responding to, disasters and terrorist acts; (2) develop a proposal to coordinate the planning, reporting, application, and other requirements and guidance for homeland security assistance programs; and (3) submit the information and proposals to the House and Senate homeland security committees.<br/>Directs the Administrator to: (1) submit to Congress, as a component of the annual Federal Preparedness Report, an evaluation of the extent to which DHS-administered grants have contributed to the progress of state, local, and tribal governments in achieving target capabilities and have led to the reduction of risk nationally and in state, local, and tribal jurisdictions; (2) report to the homeland security committees, for each fiscal year, a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the methodology used to calculate risk and compute the allocation of funds; and (3) conduct periodic reviews of grants. Requires: (1) each grant recipient and DHS to provide the Government Accountability Office (GAO) with full access to information regarding activities carried out under this title; (2) the Comptroller General to conduct annual audits of the Homeland Security Grant Program and to report to the homeland security committees; (3) grant recipients that expend $500,000 or more in funds received under this title during any fiscal year to submit to the Administrator an organization-wide financial and compliance audit report; and (4) the Secretary to conduct a recovery audit for any DHS-administered grant valued at $1 million or greater. Sets forth remedies for noncompliance.<br/>Requires the DHS Inspector General to: (1) audit each entity that receives a grant under the Urban Area Security Initiative, State Homeland Security Grant Program, or Emergency Management Performance Grants Program (under the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006) every two years and make each audit available on the Inspector General's website; (2) audit each entity that receives a grant under such programs to evaluate the use of any preparedness grant administered by DHS that was awarded before the date of this Act's enactment and make each audit available on the Inspector General's website; and (3) submit to Congress a consolidated report regarding audits conducted. Requires the Administrator to withhold 1% of the amount of each grant under such programs for audits. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) DHS should administer a coherent and coordinated system of both terrorism-focused and all-hazards grants; and (2) the amounts appropriated for grants under the Urban Area Security Initiative, the State Homeland Security Grant Program, and the Emergency Communications Operability and Interoperable Communications Grants Program in any fiscal year should be in direct proportion to the amounts authorized for those programs for FY2008 under this Act.<br/>(Sec. 203) Expresses the sense of the Senate that DHS shall conduct at least 7,500 trainings annually through the Domestic Preparedness Equipment Technical Assistance Program.

Limits the federal share of costs to 75%. Authorizes appropriations.<br/>Title V: Enhancing Security of International Travel - (Sec. 501) Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should modernize and expand the visa waiver program by simultaneously enhancing program security requirements and extending visa-free travel privileges to nationals of foreign countries that are allies in the war on terrorism.<br/>Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Secretary to certify to Congress when an air exit system is in place that can verify the departure of not less than 97% of foreign nationals that exit through U.S. airports. Provides for the waiver of low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate requirements for participation in the Visa Waiver Program after such certification if specified security conditions are met. Directs: (1) the Secretary and the Secretary of State to jointly use information from the system to establish a maximum visa overstay rate for countries participating in the Program pursuant to a waiver; and (2) the Secretary to submit to Congress and publish in the Federal Register a notice of the proposed maximum visa overstay rate and to issue a final rate not less than 60 days thereafter.<br/>Requires each alien traveling under the Visa Waiver Program, beginning on the date on which the electronic travel authorization system is fully operational, to electronically provide basic biographical information to the system before applying for admission. Directs the Secretary, upon review of such information, to determine whether the alien is eligible to travel to the United States under the Program. Revises requirements for eligibility as a Program country to require the government of a country to: (1) enter into an agreement with the United States to report or make available through Interpol to the U.S. government information about the theft or loss of passports within a strict time limit and in a specified manner; (2) accept for repatriation any citizen, former citizen, or national against whom a final executable order of removal is issued not later than three weeks after the issuance of the final order of removal; and (3) share information regarding whether nationals of that country traveling to the United States represent a threat. Requires the Secretary to: (1) report to Congress on the implementation of the electronic travel authorization system and the participation of new countries in the Program through a waiver; and (2) provide technical assistance to Program countries. Prohibits the Secretary from waiving an eligibility requirement without notifying the appropriate congressional committees at least 30 days before the effective date of the waiver.<br/>Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) develop and implement a fully automated electronic travel authorization system to collect basic biographical information to determine, in advance of travel, the eligibility of an alien to travel to the United States under the Program; and (2) charge a fee for the use of the system. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations that provide for up to a three-year period during which a determination of eligibility to travel under the Program will be valid. Permits the Secretary to revoke such determination at any time. Denies judicial review of an eligibility determination under the system. Directs the Secretary to establish an exit system that records the departure on a flight leaving the United States of every alien participating in the Program.
