	7/24/2007--Passed Senate amended. Higher Education Amendments of 2007 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise HEA programs and to extend the authorization of appropriations for them through FY2013. Title I: General Provisions - (Sec. 101) Adds definitions of a critical foreign language, distance education, and poverty line. Provides that critical foreign languages are those contained on the list designated by the Secretary of Education in the Federal Register on August 5, 1985, but allows the Secretary to set language priorities according to the purposes of a specific program and national security, economic competitiveness, and educational needs. States that poverty line refers to the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved. (Sec. 102) Revises the general definition of institution of higher education (IHE) to include schools that: (1) award degrees (not necessarily a bachelor's degree) that are acceptable for admission to a graduate or professional degree program; and (2) public or nonprofit private schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 103) Revises the definition of IHE for purposes of title IV student assistance programs. Requires graduate medical schools located outside the country, that qualified as IHEs owing to their having a state-approved clinical training program, to have continuously operated a clinical training program in at least one state that is approved by such state. Includes as proprietary IHEs and as postsecondary vocational institutions any schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 104) Elaborates on the current sense of Congress regarding the speech and association rights of students in higher education to specify that such students should not be intimidated, harassed, discouraged from speaking out, or discriminated against. (Sec. 105) Replaces the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity with an Institutional Quality and Integrity Committee to assess the process of accreditation and the eligibility and certification of such institutions for title IV student assistance programs. Sets September 30, 2012, as the Committee's termination date. (Sec. 106) Requires IHEs' biennial reviews of their alcohol and drug abuse prevention programs to include a determination as to: (1) the number of drug and alcohol-related incidents and fatalities occurring on their property or as part of their activities that are reported to them; and (2) the number and type of sanctions the IHEs impose on students or employees as a result of such incidents or fatalities. (Sec. 107) Extends an authorization of appropriations to continue coverage of prior rights and obligations for servicing outstanding bonds from certain earlier programs under HEA title VII before it was amended by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. (Sec. 108) Requires the Commission of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to develop higher education price indices (HEPIs) that accurately reflect the annual change in tuition and fees for undergraduate students in specified categories of IHEs. Directs the Secretary to report annually and share with the public, including private college guidebook publishers, information: (1) ranking IHEs according to their tuition and fee changes; (2) ranking IHEs whose tuition and fees exceed their applicable HEPI, in what are to be known as Higher Education Price Increase Watch Lists; (3) comparing each state's appropriations for public IHEs with changes in the tuition and fees for such schools; and (4) regarding the amount of need- and merit-based aid provided by each state for students in public IHEs. Requires the Secretary to develop model net price calculators and, within three years of this Act's enactment, HEA-funded IHEs to adopt and use a net price calculator to help students, families, and consumers determine the net price (tuition minus grants and discounts) of an IHE. Requires HEA-funded IHEs to include their most recent net price data in application materials. Directs the Secretary to: (1) contract with an independent organization with experience in developing consumer-friendly websites to improve the College Opportunities On-Line (COOL) website so that it better meets the needs of students, families, and consumers for accurate and appropriate IHE information; and (2) develop a model document to be known as the University and College Accountability Network (U-Can) for annually reporting specified basic information about an participating IHE, to be posted on the college information website and made available to IHEs, students, families, and other consumers. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the time and cost burdens to IHEs associated with completing the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). (Sec. 109) Prohibits the creation or maintenance of a federal database of personally identifiable student information. States that such prohibition does not apply to existing systems that are necessary for the operation of title II, IV, or VII programs or state databases that track individuals over time. (Sec. 110) Directs the Secretary to: (1) ensure that a link to current student aid information is displayed prominently on the home page of the Department of Education's website; and (2) contract with an independent organization with experience in developing consumer-friendly websites to improve the usefulness and accessibility of the Department's information on college financial planning and student aid. (Sec. 110A) Establishes a State Higher Education Information System Pilot program under which the Secretary shall award competitive grants to up to five states, consortia of states, or consortia of IHEs to: (1) design, test, and implement state-level postsecondary student data systems that provide the maximum benefits to states, IHEs, and state policymakers; and (2) examine the costs and burdens involved in implementing such systems. (Sec. 111) Revises requirements for: (1) the performance-based organization organization for delivery of federal student financial assistance; and (2) procurement flexibility. (Sec. 113) Requires IHEs that enter into educational loan arrangements, under which schools recommend and use a title IV lender in exchange for material benefits, to disclose the name of the lender in loan documentation. Requires lenders under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) or Direct Loan (DL) programs to: (1) provide students with specified written information concerning student loan costs, terms, and repayment before furnishing the loan; and (2) report annually to the Secretary on certain reimbursements provided to IHE financial aid employees. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the adequacy of FFEL and DL information provided to borrowers. Requires such report to include a model disclosure form, based on the report's findings, for lender use in providing annual loan information to the Secretary and IHEs with which they have a educational loan arrangement. Requires IHEs to provide the Secretary, prospective borrowers, and the public with the disclosure form information for loans provided by lenders with which they have such an arrangement as well as a detailed explanation of why such loans are beneficial to borrowers. (Sec. 114) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress regarding the current collection of information on the employment of postsecondary school graduates, and the feasibility and best means of collecting and displaying additional information on the employment of graduates of all types of postsecondary programs. (Sec. 115) Requires that, for graduate medical schools located outside the U.S. or Canada to qualify as IHEs under the FFEL program, beginning on July 1, 2010, at least 75% (currently, 60%) of the school's former students or graduates taking the examinations administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates must pass such examinations. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on American students who receive federal student aid to attend graduate medical schools abroad, including: (1) the amount of such aid; (2) actual and recommended graduate examination pass rates; (3) graduates who return to this country; and (4) their medical practice performance. (Sec 116) Prohibits IHEs from using federal funds to lobby for federal contracts, grants, loans, cooperative agreements, or earmarks. Title II: Teacher Quality Enhancement - (Sec. 201) Revises and reauthorizes title II part A, Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships. Eliminates the State grant and Teacher Recruitment grant programs. Turns the Partnership grant program into the revised Teacher Quality Partnership grant program. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive five-year grants to partnerships of high-need local educational agencies (LEAs), high-need schools, and IHEs for use in carrying out a pre-baccalaureate teacher preparation program, a teaching residency program, or both. Requires the pre-baccalaureate teacher preparation program to include: (1) educational reforms; (2) clinical experience and interaction; (3) induction programs for new teachers that provide them with mentoring and support for at least their first two years of teaching; and (4) teacher recruitment mechanisms. Allows partnerships to use grant funds to partner with television public broadcast stations to improve the quality of pre-baccalaureate teacher preparation programs. Requires the teaching residency program to prepare teachers for success in the high-need schools in the partnership by engaging residents in rigorous graduate-level coursework to earn a master's degree while they undertake a guided teaching apprenticeship alongside a trained and experienced mentor teacher who may be relieved of teaching duties. Requires teacher residents to be: (1) recent graduates of a four-year IHE; or (2) mid-career professionals from outside the field of education who possess strong content knowledge or a record of professional accomplishment. Provides residents with a living stipend or salary during the one-year residency program in exchange for at least three years of service in a high-need school served by the high-need LEA. Requires partnership grantees to provide an amount equal to the amount of the grant from nonfederal sources for program activites, unless the Secretary grants them a hardship waiver. Adds programs that offer alternative routes to state certification and licensure to the teacher preparation programs that must provide annual reports to the Secretary concerning certain measures of program effectiveness, such as student success on certification or licensure assessments. Prohibits the Secretary from using such information to create a national list or ranking of states, institutions, or schools. Requires title IV-eligible IHEs that provide teacher training to set annual quantifiable goals for: (1) increasing the number of prospective teachers trained in teacher shortage areas; and (2) linking the training they provide more closely with the needs of schools and the instructional decisions new teachers face in the classroom. Directs such IHEs to publicly report on their performance toward such goals. Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2013 for the Teacher Quality Partnership grant program.
