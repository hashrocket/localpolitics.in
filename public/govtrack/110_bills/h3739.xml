Amends the Arizona Water Settlements Act to make the Southern Arizona Water Rights Settlement effective as of the date the Secretary of the Interior publishes in the Federal Register a statement of findings that specified conditions apply, including that the judgment and decree attached to the Tohono O'odham settlement agreement has been approved by the state court having jurisdiction over the Gila River adjudication proceedings.
