Directs the Secretary to establish a trail plan. Authorizes the use of helicopter access to construct and maintain a joint Forest Service-Snohomish County telecommunications repeater site to provide improved communication for safety, health, and emergency purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands in the Wild Sky Wilderness by purchase, donation, or exchange, with priority to be given to specified Priority Acquisition Lands. Requires the boundaries of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and the Wild Sky Wilderness to be adjusted to encompass any lands so acquired. Requires the Secretary to accept specified lands within the Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington, from the Chelan County Public Utility District if the District offers such lands to the Secretary (in title acceptable to the Secretary, and provided there is no hazardous material on the site) in exchange for a permanent easement, including helicopter access, to maintain an existing telemetry site to monitor snow pack on land within the Wenatchee National Forest, Washington. Provides for extinguishment of the easement and reversion of all conveyed rights to the United States if the District no longer needs to maintain a telemetry site.<br/>
