	6/24/2008--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on May 20, 2008. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Recognizes, on the 12th anniversary of that attack, the service and sacrifice of the 19 members of the U.S. Air Force who died in the terrorist bombing of the Khobar Towers U.S. military housing compound in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Calls upon every American to pause and pay tribute to those brave airmen. Extends the continued sympathies of Congress to the families of those who died. Assures the members of the Armed Forces serving anywhere in the world that their well-being and interests will at all times be given the highest priority.<br/>
