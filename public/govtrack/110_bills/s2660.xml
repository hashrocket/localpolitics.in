	2/25/2008--Introduced.<br/>Consumer Protection and Cost Accountability Act - Amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to consider whether a rate or charge made, demanded, or received by a Transmission Organization (TO) would enable the TO to provide or facilitate reliable service to consumers at the lowest reasonable cost.<br/>Instructs FERC, in determining whether a TO filing to establish or change a rate or charge is consistent with specified requirements, to consider whether the rate or charge would: (1) provide consumer benefits that outweigh any anticipated costs to consumers as demonstrated by a cost-benefit analysis submitted by the TO; or (2) have only a de minimis impact upon the total delivered costs to the consumer.<br/>Directs FERC to ensure that each TO is subject to biennial, independent audits.<br/>
