	4/3/2008--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of the United States House of Representatives that: (1) the elimination of poverty and hunger, assurance of basic health and education for all, and resolution of environmental crises remain key foreign policy goals for the United States; and (2) a Global Marshall Plan holds potentially transformative power to foreign development assistance that would demonstrate U.S. commitment to peace and prosperity to people who may have doubted the dedication of the United States to those ideals.
