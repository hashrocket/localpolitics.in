(Sec. 108) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Transportation, heads of other appropriate federal departments and agencies, and Amtrak to report to Congress on the current system for preclearance and screening of rail and airline passengers and baggage, as well as freight railroad traffic, between the United States and Canada, including progress on a rail passenger preclearance protocol. (Sec. 109) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and issue guidance for a rail worker security training program to prepare front-line workers for potential threat conditions. Requires rail carriers to: (1) develop a rail worker security training program based on such guidance and submit it for review by the Secretary of Homeland Security; and (2) not later than one year after such review, complete the training of all front-line workers. (Sec. 110) Sets forth certain whistleblower protections for rail employees or other persons who have provided information regarding a reasonably perceived threat to security to the employer, federal government, or Congress, or who have refused to violate or assist in the violation of any regulation related to rail security. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to require rail carriers transporting high hazardous materials to develop high hazard material security risk mitigation plans containing appropriate measures (including alternative routing and temporary shipment suspension options) to address assessed risks to high consequence targets. Requires rail carriers transporting high hazardous materials on a right-of-way to institute such plans when the threat levels of the Homeland Security Advisory System are high or severe or specific intelligence of probable or imminent threat exist to: (1) a high-consequence target being within the catastrophic impact zone of the railroad right-of-way used to transport high hazardous material; or (2) rail infrastructure or operations being within the immediate vicinity of such target. (Sec. 112) Sets forth civil penalties for violators of regulations prescribed or orders issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to rail security. (Sec. 113) Authorizes a rail police officer of one rail carrier to be temporarily assigned for duty to another rail carrier.

Title II: Improved Motor Carrier, Bus, and Hazardous Material Security - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to, among other things: (1) document existing and proposed routes for the transportation of radioactive and non-radioactive hazardous materials by motor carrier, and develop a framework for using a Geographic Information System-based approach to characterize routes in the National Hazardous Materials Route Registry; (2) document the concerns of the public, motor carriers, and State, local, territorial, and tribal governments about the highway routing of hazardous materials; (3) develop a tool that will enable State officials to examine potential routes for the highway transportation of hazardous material and assess specific security risks associated with each route and explore alternative mitigation measures; (4) complete an assessment of the safety and national security benefits of existing requirements for route plans for explosives and radioactive materials; and (5) require motor carriers that have a hazardous material safety permit to operate in transporting hazardous materials to maintain written or electronic route plans that meet certain requirements if the Secretary of Transportation determines, under the assessment, that such requirement would enhance the nation's security and safety without imposing unreasonable costs or burdens upon motor carriers.
