	7/23/2007--Passed House amended. Expresses the sense of Congress that, as the leaders of the United States and the Republic of India have expressed commitment to the values of human freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, it is in U.S. interests to address the treatment of the Dalits and Tribals in India by: (1) raising the issue of caste discrimination and untouchability; (2) encouraging the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to ensure that the needs of Dalit organizations are incorporated in project development; (3) ensuring that projects that positively impact Dalit and Tribal communities, especially Dalit women, are developed; (4) ensuring that cooperative research programs targeting rural health care, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and rural technology contain proper focus on the Dalits and Tribals; (5) ensuring that anyone receiving U.S. government funds in India is aware that it is U.S. policy that caste discrimination is unacceptable and that the United States is committed to eliminating it; (6) ensuring that qualified Dalits are not discouraged from working with the U.S. government or U.S.-funded organizations in India; and (7) discussing the issue of caste in the context of congressional delegations.<br/>
