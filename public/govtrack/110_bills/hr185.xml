	<summary>
	4/1/2008--Passed House amended. States that any comprehensive Middle East peace agreement must resolve all outstanding issues relating to the legitimate rights of all refugees in the Middle East, including Jews, Christians, and other displaced populations. States that the President should instruct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations and all U.S. representatives in bilateral and multilateral fora to: (1) use U.S. influence to ensure that Middle East refugee resolutions which include a reference to the required resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue must also include a similarly explicit reference to the resolution of the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries; and (2) make clear that the U.S. government supports the position that as an integral part of any comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace the issue of refugees from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf must include recognition of the legitimate rights of, and losses incurred by, all refugees displaced from Arab countries including Jews, Christians, and other groups.
