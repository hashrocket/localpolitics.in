	7/10/2007--Introduced.<br/>English Language Instruction Improvement Act of 2007 - Amends title III (Language Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to raise, from 6.5% to 9%, the amount of title III appropriations devoted to the National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition and Language Instruction Educational Programs and a program providing competitive grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) for teacher training to improve classroom instruction for limited English proficient children. Alters such grant program by allowing the provision of grants directly to states and local educational agencies (LEAs) and eliminating the requirement that IHE grantees be in consortia with states or LEAs. Adds to allowable grant uses: (1) the development and dissemination of best practices in teaching individuals with limited English proficiency to high levels of achievement pursuant to challenging state academic performance standards or to high levels of multiligual proficiency; (2) research and evaluation of the education provided to such individuals; and (3) technical assistance to states and LEAs in meeting the requirements of title III.
