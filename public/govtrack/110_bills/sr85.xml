	<summary>
	2/16/2007--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States deplores the past and continuing violation of the human rights and religious freedoms of minority populations in Arab and Muslim countries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf; and (2) with respect to Jews, Christians, and other displaced populations from countries in the region any comprehensive Middle East peace agreement must resolve all outstanding issues, including the legitimate rights of all refugees from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf. Urges the President to instruct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations and all U.S. representatives in bilateral and multilateral fora that they should ensure that: (1) relevant text refers to multiple refugee populations that have been caused by the Arab-Israeli conflict; and (2) any explicit reference to the resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue is matched by a similar reference to the resolution of the issue of Jewish, Christian, and other refugees from Arab and Muslim countries from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf. Clarifies that the United States supports the position that as an integral part of any comprehensive peace the issue of refugees and the mass violations of human rights of minorities in Arab and Muslim countries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf must be resolved in a manner that includes: (1) consideration of the legitimate rights of all refugees displaced from Arab and Muslim countries from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf; and (2) recognition of the losses incurred by Jews, Christians, and other minority groups as a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
