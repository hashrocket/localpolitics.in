	9/18/2008--Introduced.<br/>Loan Shark Prevention Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to limit: (1) the annual percentage rate (APR) applicable to any extension of credit to a maximum of 8 percentage points above the interest rate on tax underpayments established under the Internal Revenue Code; and (2) the amount of any fee or charge that a creditor may impose, under the terms of a credit transaction, to $15. Declares that, in the case of any credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, no fee (including any annual fee, late payment fee, or over-the-limit fee) may be imposed on such account until 30 days after the obligor receives a specific notice of the imposition of such fee. Requires such a notice to explain how, when, and why a fee will be imposed and what options the obligor may have for addressing the fee or any reason for it, including the prevention of any future imposition of such fee.<br/>
