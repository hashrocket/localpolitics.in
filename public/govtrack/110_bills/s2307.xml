Requires the Chairman of the Council, through the Committee, to develop a strategic plan for the GCRP for the 10-year period beginning in 2008 and submit the plan to Congress within a year after this Act's enactment.<br/>Requires such plan to: (1) include a detailed plan for research, assessment, information management, public participation, outreach, and budget; (2) be updated every five years; (3) provide information to decision makers and end users for the formulation of effective decisions and strategies for measuring, predicting, mitigating, and adapting to global change; (4) describe development of regional scenarios, assessment of model predictability, and assessment of climate change impacts among activities required to achieve goals and priorities and propose measures to address gaps and growing needs for such activities; (5) make recommendations for the coordination of the global change research and assessment activities of the United States with activities of other nations and international organizations; (6) detail budget requirements for federal global change research and assessment activities to be conducted under the plan; (7) include a process for identifying information needed by decision makers to develop policies to plan for and address projected impacts of global change; (8) identify and sustain the observing systems currently employed in collecting data relevant to global and regional climate change research and prioritize additional systems that may be needed to ensure adequate data collection and monitoring of global change; (9) identify existing capabilities and gaps in climate prediction and scenario-based modeling capabilities for forecasting and projecting climate impacts at local and regional levels and propose measures to address such gaps; (10) describe specific activities designed to facilitate outreach and data and information exchange with regional, state, and local governments; and (11) identify and describe U.S. ecosystems and geographic regions that are likely to experience similar impacts of global change or are likely to share similar vulnerabilities to global change.<br/>Revises the Plan's research elements. Requires the Plan to provide recommendations for collaboration within the federal government and among nations to establish a common assessment and modeling framework that may be used in both research and operations to project, predict, and assess the vulnerability of natural and managed ecosystems and of human society in the context of other environmental and social changes.<br/>Requires the Chairman of the Council to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council under which the latter shall: (1) evaluate the scientific content of the Plan; (2) provide information and advice obtained from the United States and international sources, and recommend priorities for future global and regional climate research and assessment; and (3) address such other studies on emerging priorities.<br/>Requires the Secretary of Commerce to execute an agreement with the National Research Council to: (1) examine existing research, potential risks (including adverse impacts to the marine environment), and the effectiveness of ocean iron fertilization or other coastal and ocean carbon sequestration technologies; and (2) identify domestic and international regulatory mechanisms and regulatory gaps for controlling the deployment of such technologies and provide recommendations for addressing such regulatory gaps.<br/>(Sec. 106) Requires the President to establish a Global Change Research Coordination Office to: (1) manage, in conjunction with the Committee, interagency coordination and program integration of global change research activities and budget requests; (2) ensure that the activities and programs of each federal agency participating in the GCRP address the goals and objectives identified in the strategic research plan and interagency implementation plans; (3) arrange funding for partnership projects that address the GCRP's critical research objectives or operational goals; (4) review and provide recommendations on all annual appropriation requests from participating agencies; (5) provide technical and administrative support to the Committee; (6) serve as a point of contact for technical and programmatic information on federal climate change activities; and (7) conduct public outreach. Authorizes interagency funding of the Office and requires the Director to report to specified congressional committees on such funding.<br/>(Sec. 107) Requires the President to: (1) provide an opportunity to the Committee and the Office to review and comment of the budget estimate of each agency involved in global change research in the context of the Plan; and (2) submit an integrated budget plan at the time of the annual budget request to Congress.<br/>(Sec. 108) Requires: (1) the Committee to develop a list of priority areas for research and development on climate change that are not being adequately addressed by federal agencies; and (2) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to transmit the list to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for funding through the Science and Technology Policy Institute. Authorizes funding to be appropriated to the NSF for research in those priority areas.<br/>(Sec. 109) Requires the President to periodically submit to Congress a single, integrated, comprehensive assessment on information being developed under such Act.<br/>(Sec. 110) Repeals a declaration that such Act does not preclude or delay federal planning or action to address the threats of stratospheric ozone depletion or global climate change.<br/>(Sec. 111) Requires the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to report to specified congressional committees on the strategy to restore the decommissioned and scaled down climate sensors scheduled for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R Series.<br/>(Sec. 112) Requires the NSF to contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to conduct: (1) an independent review of the implementation of the Global Change Research Act of 1990 and the National Climate Service and the extent to which scientific communications and findings are inappropriately subject to nonscientific policy considerations; and (2) an independent review of the process undertaken by the GCRP in developing the strategic plan and the national assessments that evaluates the extent to which the scientific communications and findings were inappropriately subjected to nonscientific policy considerations. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2013.<br/>(Sec. 113) Requires the President to establish guidelines and implement a plan that requires specified agencies to adopt policies to ensure the integrity of scientific communications.
