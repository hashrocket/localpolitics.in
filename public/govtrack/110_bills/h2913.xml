	6/28/2007--Introduced.<br/>Pollinator Habitat Protection Act of 2007 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to require that conservation programs, except the farmland protection program, establish a priority and provide incentives for: (1) increasing habitat for native and managed pollinators; and (2) establishing cropping systems, integrated pest management regimes, and other practices to protect native and managed pollinators. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture should: (1) designate pollinator protection as a national priority resource concern for conservation programs administered by the Department of Agriculture; and (2) continue efforts to make nurseries and land managers aware of pollinator-friendly plants.<br/>
