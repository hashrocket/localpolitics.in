	9/18/2008--Introduced.<br/>Debt Repayment Instead of Pork Act of 2008 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report providing new budget authority for earmarks if the enactment of such measure as reported, the adoption and enactment of that amendment, or the enactment of legislation in the form recommended in that conference report would cause the level of total outlays for earmarks for any fiscal year to exceed the amount of the estimated budget surplus for that fiscal year. Makes it out of order for any fiscal year in which there is no budget surplus to consider any such measure that carries an earmark. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), by March 1 of each calendar year, to prepare, and submit to the congressional budget committees, an estimate of the surplus or deficit for the next fiscal year.
