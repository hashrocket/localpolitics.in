Permits grant funds to be used to: (1) identify such property owners and renters; (2) notify them when their properties become included in, or are excluded from, an area having special flood hazards about the effect of such inclusion or exclusion on the applicability of the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement; (3) educate them regarding the flood risk and reduction of risk in their community and regarding the benefits and costs of flood insurance; and (4) encourage them to maintain or acquire coverage. Sets forth requirements regarding cost-sharing and limits on administrative costs. Requires the Director to provide for such agencies to submit applications for grants and for competitive selection, based on criteria established by the Director. Lists selection considerations. Authorizes the Director to use up to 50% of amounts available for grants in each fiscal year in areas determined to have the most immediate need for such activities.<br/>
