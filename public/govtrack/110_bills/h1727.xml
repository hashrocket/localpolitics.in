Authorizes such consortia to: (1) conduct basic, translational, and clinical paralysis research; (2) facilitate and enhance the dissemination of clinical and scientific findings; and (3) replicate the findings of consortia members or other researchers for scientific and translational purposes. Authorizes the Director to provide for a mechanism to educate and disseminate information on NIH paralysis programs and research activities, through which the Director can receive comments from the public. Title II: Paralysis Rehabilitation Research and Care - (Sec. 201) Requires the Director to award grants for multicenter networks of clinical sites that will collaborate to design clinical rehabilitation intervention protocols and measures of outcomes on forms of paralysis that result from central nervous system trauma, disorders, and/or stroke.
