	<summary>
	8/1/2008--Passed Senate amended. Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2008 - (Sec. 3) Amends federal transportation law to authorize appropriations for FY2008-FY2013 for: (1) railroad safety, including the safe transportation of hazardous materials; (2) research and development (R&amp;amp;D); (3) the purchase of Gage Restraint Measurement System vehicles and track geometry vehicles or other comparable technology to assess track safety; and (4) rail security personnel in Department of Transportation (DOT) regional offices and in Washington, DC. Title I: Railroad Safety Risk Reduction and Strategy - (Sec. 101) Requires the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to have an Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety, who shall be the FRA's Chief Safety Officer.<br/>(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to develop: (1) a long-term railroad safety strategy that includes an annual plan for meeting specific goals; and (2) a railroad safety risk reduction pilot program (with appropriations authorized for FY2009-FY2010). (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to require each railroad carrier that is a Class I railroad, a railroad carrier that has inadequate safety performance, or a railroad that provides intercity passenger or commuter rail passenger transportation to develop, and submit for FRA approval, a railroad safety risk reduction program, including technology implementation and fatigue management plans, to reduce the rate of railroad accidents and injuries. Grants the Secretary authority to assess civil penalties for violations of such requirements. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to ensure that railroad carriers required to submit a railroad safety risk reduction program that includes in its technology implementation plan a schedule for implementation of a positive train control system complies with such schedule by December 31, 2018, unless the railroad implements its system by an earlier date. (Sec. 106) Revises hours of service requirements for a train employee to provide that such employee may not be required to be on duty: (1) where the employee has spent in any calendar month a total of 276 hours on duty, or waiting for transportation, or in deadhead transportation (limbo time), to a place of final release, or in any other mandatory service for the carrier; (2) for more than 12 consecutive hours; or (3) unless the employee has had at least 10 consecutive (currently, eight consecutive) hours off duty during the previous 24 hours. Prohibits requiring or allowing such an employee to remain or go on duty after that employee has initiated an on-duty period each day for: (1) six consecutive days, unless the employee has had at least 48 consecutive hours off duty at the employee's home terminal; or (2) each day for seven consecutive days, if permitted by a collective bargaining agreement or provided for by a pilot program, unless the employee has had at least 72 consecutive hours of duty at a home terminal. Caps the total number of hours that a train employee may spend on-duty and waiting for deadhead transportation on a train at 15 hours, unless the train is delayed by an accident, a major equipment failure, or a delay resulting from a cause unknown and unforeseeable to a railroad carrier.<br/>Revises hours of service requirements for signal employees, including signal employees of contractors or subcontractors. Repeals the requirement that a signal employee have at least eight consecutive hours off duty during any 24 hour period. Makes 12 consecutive hours the maximum time on duty, unless the employee has had at least 10 consecutive hours off duty during the previous 24 hours.<br/>Prohibits a signal employee from being allowed to go on duty under certain emergency authority to conduct routine repairs, routine maintenance, or routine inspection of signal systems. Prohibits a railroad or railroad contractor or subcontractor from communicating with a train or signal employee during time off duty, except to notify the employee of an emergency situation. Authorizes a railroad and its directly affected employees to develop jointly, and submit for the Secretary's approval, an alternate hours of service regime that would increase the maximum hours an employee may be allowed to remain on duty or decrease the minimum hours an employee may be required to rest. Subjects commuter and intercity passenger rail employees to existing hours of service requirements, until the earlier of: (1) the effective date of new regulations establishing different hours of service requirements for such employees; or (2) three years after enactment of this Act.
