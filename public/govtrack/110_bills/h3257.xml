	7/31/2007--Introduced.<br/>Fitness Integrated with Teaching Kids Act or the FIT Kids Act - Requires state accountability systems, required under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), to measure not only student academic progress, but their progress toward a national goal of 150 minutes of weekly physical education in elementary school and 225 minutes of weekly physical education in middle and high schools. Amends the ESEA to require annual state and local educational agency report cards to include specified information on school health and physical education programs. Includes the promotion of healthy, active lifestyles by students within ESEA grant programs that support school counseling, safe and drug-free schools and communities, smaller learning communities, community learning centers, parental involvement in their childrens' education, and the construction of healthy high-performing schools. Revises the professional development program for teachers and principals to include training for physical and health education teachers, and training on improving students' health habits and participation in physical activities. Directs the Secretary of Education to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study and provide recommendations regarding school programs to improve student health and participation in physical activities. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to states to implement assessments effectively measuring cognitive development in physical education and physical activity skills, motor skills development, and how much students value physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction.<br/>
