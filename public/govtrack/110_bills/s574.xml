	2/13/2007--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect U.S. Armed Forces members who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq; and (2) Congress disapproves of President George W. Bush's decision announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional U.S. combat troops to Iraq. Amends the United States Policy in Iraq Act to require reports every 30 days on specified aspects of U.S. policy and military operations in Iraq until all U.S. combat brigades have been redeployed from Iraq.
