	4/12/2007--Introduced.<br/>Amends the Public Health Service Act to adjust the minimum state allotments for Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness programs to be the greater of the amount otherwise received by the state for FY2006 or $600,000. (Current law sets forth a minimum allotment of $300,000 per state.) Provides that if the funds appropriated are insufficient for all states to receive the minimum allotment, then states shall receive no less than the amount they received in FY2006 with additional money spent to give states the minimum of $600,000.<br/>
