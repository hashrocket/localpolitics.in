	3/1/2007--Introduced.<br/>National Carbon Dioxide Storage Capacity Assessment Act of 2007 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), acting through the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, to develop a methodology for conducting a national assessment of the geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide. Sets forth elements for the Secretary to consider in developing the methodology. Requires the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to cooperate with the Secretary to ensure the usefulness and success of the assessment.<br/>Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide the heads of stakeholder federal agencies, the heads of state land management agencies, industry stakeholders, and the public with an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed methodology; (2) convene a committee of subject matter experts to review the methodology for capacity and risk estimation; (3) publish a description of the final methodology and issue a public report that responds to the comments received and the methodology review; (4) complete a national assessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide using the methodology; (5) establish a database on the Internet accessible to the public that provides the results of the assessment and includes the data necessary to rank potential storage sites for capacity and risk; and (6) report to Congress on the findings of the assessment.<br/>
