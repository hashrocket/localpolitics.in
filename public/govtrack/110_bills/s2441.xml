Provides similar authority an outlines similar procedures for the emergency employment of a physical search.<br/>Requires the AG, after authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device on an emergency basis, to apply to the Court for an authorization order within 168 (current law requires 48) hours after the emergency installation and use.<br/>Authorizes the Court to sit en banc when: (1) necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of Court decisions; or (2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.<br/>Requires the Inspectors General of the Department of Justice and relevant elements of the intelligence community to complete a comprehensive audit of the Terrorist Surveillance Program and any closely related intelligence activities, to include acquiring all documents relevant to such programs, including memoranda concerning legal authority of a program, program authorizations, certifications to telecommunications carriers, and court orders.
