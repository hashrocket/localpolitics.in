	2/15/2007--Introduced.<br/>Affirms that: (1) initiating military action against Iran without congressional approval does not fall within the President's &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot; powers under the Constitution; and (2) seeking congressional authority prior to taking military action against Iran is not discretionary, but a legal and constitutional requirement. Rejects any suggestion that P.L. 107-40 (the authorization of force resolution approved in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001) or P.L. 107-243 (the authorization of force resolution approved by Congress to go to war with Iraq) extends to authorizing military action against Iran, including over its nuclear program.<br/>
