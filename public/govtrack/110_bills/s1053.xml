	3/29/2007--Introduced.<br/>Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a resource study of and submit a report on the Rim of the Valley Corridor in California to evaluate a range of alternatives for protecting the Corridor's resources, including the alternative of establishing all or part of the Corridor as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Lists the objectives the Secretary shall seek to achieve in conducting the study. Directs the Secretary to analyze the potential impact that establishment of all or part of the Rim of the Valley Corridor as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is likely to have on land within or bordering the area that is privately owned at the time such study is conducted. Requires the report to discuss the concerns of private landowners within the existing boundaries of the Recreation Area. Instructs the Secretary, as part of evaluating each alternative considered under such study, to estimate the impact of implementing the alternative on staffing and other potential costs to federal, state, and local agencies and other organizations.<br/>
