	5/22/2007--Passed House amended. Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2007 - Title I: Reform of Regulation of Enterprises and Federal Home Loan Banks - Subtitle A: Improvement of Safety and Soundness - (Sec. 101) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Act) to establish, in place of the present Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, a Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), headed by a Director (Director) possessing general supervisory and regulatory authority over the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the federal home loan banks (&quot;the regulated entities&quot;). (Sec. 102) Requires the Director to establish standards for each regulated entity, especially standards relating to: (1) adequacy of internal controls and information systems; (2) independence and adequacy of internal audit systems; (3) management of credit and counterparty risk; (4) management of any asset and investment portfolio; (5) investments and acquisitions; and (6) overall risk management processes, particularly adequacy of oversight by senior management and the board of directors, and of processes and policies to identify and control material risks, including reputational risks. (Sec. 103) Establishes the Federal Housing Enterprise Board to advise the Director. (Sec. 104) Instructs the Director to require a regulated entity to: (1) submit a timely report upon its discovery that it has purchased or sold a fraudulent loan or financial instrument, or if it suspects a possible fraud relating to a purchase or sale of any loan or financial instrument; (2) establish and maintain procedures designed to discover such transactions; and (3) report annually the total value of charitable contributions made to nonprofit organizations. (Sec. 106) Instructs the Director to establish and collect from the regulated entities annual assessments to provide for FHFA costs and expenses. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the Director to appoint accountants, economists, specialists in financial markets or information technology, and examiners with respect to supervision and regulation of the regulated entities. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to subject federal home loan banks to examinations by the Director. (Sec. 108) Specifies factors the Director may consider when determining (as under present law) whether to prohibit the regulated entities from providing compensation to any executive officer of an entity that is not reasonable and comparable with compensation for employment in other similar businesses involving similar duties and responsibilities. Authorizes the Director to consider any relevant factors, including any wrongdoing on the officer's part. Authorizes the Director to require a regulated entity to withhold any payment, transfer, or disbursement of compensation to an executive officer, or to place such compensation in an escrow account, during the review of the compensation's reasonableness and comparability. (Sec. 109) Revises the Director's authority to provide for review of regulated entities by a rating organization. Authorizes the Director to contract with any entity the Director considers appropriate to conduct such a review. Repeals the requirement that such entity be a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. (Sec. 110) Requires each regulated entity to: (1) establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, or designate an office to be responsible for carrying out all matters relating to diversity in management, employment, and business activities; and (2) develop standards and procedures to ensure inclusion and utilization of minorities and women, and minority- and women-owned businesses, in all the regulated entity's business activities. (Sec. 112) Declares that the submission to FHFA by any person of any information for any purpose in the course of any of FHFA supervisory or regulatory process shall not be construed as waiving, destroying, or otherwise affecting any privilege such person may claim with respect to such information under federal or state law as to any person or entity other than FHFA. (Sec. 113) Revises requirements governing risk-based capital requirements. Instructs the Director to establish risk-based capital requirements (as under present law) to ensure that the regulated entities, including the federal home loan banks, operate in a safe and sound manner, maintaining sufficient capital and reserves to support the risks that arise in their operations and management.
