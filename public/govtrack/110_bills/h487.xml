	5/7/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)<br/>Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2007 - Amends the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act to make member landowners eligible for the additional financial compensation provided to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for the acquisition by the federal government of 104,492 acres of land of the Tribe and member landowners for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project. Defines &quot;member landowner&quot; as a member of the Tribe (or an heir of such a member) that owned land on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation that was acquired by the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make five annual deposits into the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. Rewrites requirements concerning the investment of the Trust Fund. Requires the investment of separate principal and interest accounts within such Fund. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury: (1) to annually review with the Tribe the results of the investment activities and financial status of the Fund; and (2) if investing the Fund pursuant to such requirements is not practicable or would result in adverse consequences, to modify those requirements to the least extent necessary. Authorizes the plan prepared for the use of payments to the Tribe to provide for payment of additional compensation to member landowners. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to assist the Tribe in claims processing by providing any record requested to identify the heirs of member landowners within 90 days after receiving a request. Extinguishes all monetary claims of a member landowner or an heir of a member landowner against the United States for the taking by the United States of land or property of the Tribe for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project upon acceptance by such member landowner or heir of any payment by the Tribe for damages resulting from the taking.
