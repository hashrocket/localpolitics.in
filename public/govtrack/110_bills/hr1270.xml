	6/18/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Recognizes the efforts of: (1) southern African trade unions, religious leaders, and advocacy groups to raise awareness about a possible weapons transfer to Zimbabwe as part of a campaign to address Zimbabwe's worsening political, economic, and humanitarian crisis; and (2) southern African governments which denied access through their territories for a weapons shipment destined for a regime that continues to perpetuate gross human rights violations against its own citizens. Urges the United States to continue to work with African governments and multilateral institutions to compel Robert Mugabe's regime to respect the will of its citizens and find a peaceful solution to the current political standoff. Urges the U.S. Permanent Representative at the United Nations to advocate for an international moratorium on arms shipments to Zimbabwe until democracy, human rights, and the rule of law are respected by the government of Zimbabwe.
