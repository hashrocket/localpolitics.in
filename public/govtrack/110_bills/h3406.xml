	8/3/2007--Introduced.<br/>Success in the Middle Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Education to make matching grants to states, based on their proportion of poor children aged 5 to 17, to: (1) implement state middle school improvement plans that describe what students must master to successfully complete the middle grades and matriculate to an academically rigorous high school; and (2) award competitive matching subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to develop and implement a comprehensive local middle school improvement plan for each eligible school. Favors LEAs with high proportions of poor children and eligible schools. Defines &quot;eligible schools&quot; as those where: (1) a majority of middle grade students matriculate to high schools with graduation rates below 60%; (2) more than 25% of the students who finish grade five exhibit key risk factors or warning signs for failure; and (3) a majority of middle grade students are not rated proficient on required state assessments in mathematics, reading, or language arts. Permits states to make subgrants to LEAs that did not receive a competitive subgrant to assist them in applying for competitive subgrants and developing comprehensive local middle school improvement plans. Provides the Secretary with funding to: (1) create a national clearinghouse in best middle level educational practices and a national database identifying factors that facilitate or impede middle grade student achievement; (2) require certain educational field research designed to enhance the performance of middle grade schools and students; (3) create a research and development center that addresses topics pertinent to middle grade schools; and (4) provide grants to entities that partner with states and LEAs to develop, adapt, or replicate effective models for turning around low-performing middle grade schools.<br/>
