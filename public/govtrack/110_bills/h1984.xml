	4/20/2007--Introduced.<br/>Applies Buy America requirements to an entire bridge project if they apply to a component part of the project. (Buy America requires the use of steel, iron, and manufactured products produced in the United States for certain transportation-related projects unless, among other exceptions, inclusion of domestic material will increase the cost of the overall project contract by more than 25 percent.)<br/>
