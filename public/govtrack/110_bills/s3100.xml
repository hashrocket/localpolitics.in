Provides for mandatory availability of paper ballots at polling places.<br/>Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to make research grants for development of election-dedicated voting system software. Requires states to make unannounced random hand counts of the voter-verified paper ballots in a federal election.<br/>Directs the EAC to establish: (1) a pre-registration implementation grant program; (2) an automatic re-registration grant program; and (3) a computerized system capable of communicating and exchanging data among participating states (interoperability).<br/>Prohibits voter caging practices (those preventing voting or registration through the reliance by officials on certain non-forwardable or non-returned documents).
