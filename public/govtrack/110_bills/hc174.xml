	6/22/2007--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 should be modified to allow for duck and goose hunting during the last week of August in areas north of 49 degrees north latitude, as approved by the parties to the appropriate international agreement; and (2) such an extended hunting season will improve hunting opportunities in Alaska without causing negative impacts on waterfowl populations, will generate additional revenue that may be used for the management and conservation of wildlife species in Alaska, and will continue to provide for the conservation and enhancement of waterfowl populations; and (3) the United States should take immediate steps to begin discussions with the appropriate parties to ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to harvest migratory ducks and geese in an equitable manner.<br/>
