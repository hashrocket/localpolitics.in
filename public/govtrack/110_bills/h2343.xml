	8/1/2008--Reported to House amended, Part I. Education Begins at Home Act of 2008 - (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to states, Indians, territories, and possessions to establish or expand quality early childhood home visitation programs for families that are expecting a child or have pre-kindergarten children. Allots funds among state grantees on the basis of their share of children from birth through age five who are from impoverished families. Directs the Secretary to approve grant applications on the basis of recommendations from a peer review panel that assesses the quality of applications by considering factors such as how the applicant: (1) promotes collaboration among a broad range of child and family services programs; and (2) plans to prioritize serving communities in high need of home visitation programs. Requires each state grantee to: (1) provide voluntary early childhood home visitation at least once a month to as many of such families as is practicable; (2) reserve 10% of its grant for the provision of training and technical assistance to such programs; (3) include representatives from high quality early childhood home visitation programs in an existing state-level early childhood coordinating body that meets regularly to address policy and implementation issues; and (4) use no more than 5% of its grant on administration. Requires states to raise nonfederal matching funds equal to 10% of their allotment for FY2011, 20% of their allotment for FY2012, and 30% of their allotment for FY2013. Authorizes appropriations for such grant program for FY2009-FY2013. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) and experienced public or private community-based entities to support and expand quality, local early childhood home visitation programs for families that have English language learners and are expecting a child or have pre-kindergarten children. Directs the Secretary to approve grant applications on the basis of their quality and peer review panel recommendations. Requires grantees to: (1) provide voluntary early childhood home visitation at least once a month to as many of such families as is practicable; (2) eliminate gaps in children's health and developmental services from birth to entry into kindergarten; (3) refer such families to additional community resources; (4) offer such families group meetings (at program discretion) at least once a month that allow parents to address their challenges in a supportive environment; (5) provide training and technical assistance to early childhood home visitation staff; and (6) coordinate existing early childhood home visitation programs. Authorizes appropriations for such grant program for FY2009-FY2013. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of Defense to make competitive grants to LEAs, schools, and community-based organizations that serve military dependents to support and expand high quality early childhood home visitation programs for military families that are expecting a child or have pre-kindergarten children. Directs the Secretary to approve grant applications on the basis of their quality and peer review panel recommendations. Requires grantees to: (1) provide voluntary early childhood home visitation at least once a month to as many of such families as is practicable; (2) eliminate gaps in children's health and developmental services from birth to entry into kindergarten; (3) refer such families to additional community resources; (4) offer such families group meetings (at program discretion) at least once a month that allow parents to address their challenges in a supportive environment; (5) provide training and technical assistance to early childhood home visitation staff; and (6) coordinate existing early childhood home visitation programs. Authorizes appropriations for such grant program for FY2009-FY2013. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to conduct an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of this Act's home visitation programs and submit interim and final reports to Congress on such evaluation. (Sec. 8) Requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress on activities carried out pursuant to this Act. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a public information and educational campaign to inform the public and new parents about the importance of proper care for infants and children under five years of age.
