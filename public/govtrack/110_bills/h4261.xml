	12/4/2007--Introduced.<br/>Safe Toys Act - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and the Flammable Fabrics Act to increase civil penalties for various violations under those Acts. Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to expand: (1) the requirement that manufacturers certify conformity to all applicable consumer product safety standards under the Act or under other Acts enforced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC); and (2) the authorization of the CPSC to prescribe reasonable testing programs for consumer products subject to standards under the Act or under Acts enforced by the CPSC. (Current law requires certification and allows testing programs under the Act, but makes no reference to other Acts enforced by the CPSC.) Requires the CPSC to maintain on its website a current list of all products with such certificates and allows the CPSC to publish such a list.<br/>
