	9/20/2007--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on August 3, 2007. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Native American $1 Coin Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $1 coins in commemoration of Native Americans and important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development and history of the United States.<br/>Requires, effective beginning January 1, 2008, that such coins have designs: (1) on the obverse bearing the &quot; Sacagawea design;&quot; and (2) on the reverse bearing images celebrating important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the history and development of the United States.<br/>States that, if the date of the enactment of this Act is after August 25, 2007, such design shall be implemented beginning January 1, 2009. Requires edge-incusing of the inscriptions &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; and &quot;In God We Trust&quot; in a manner that preserves the distinctive coin edge so that its denomination is readily discernible, including by individuals who are blind or visually impaired.<br/>Requires the number of $1 coins minted and issued in a year with the Sacagawea-design on the obverse to be not less than 20% of the total number of $1 coins minted and issued in such year.<br/>Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to carry out an aggressive, cost-effective, continuing campaign to encourage commercial enterprises to accept and dispense $1 coins that have the so-called &quot;Sacagawea design.&quot;<br/>
