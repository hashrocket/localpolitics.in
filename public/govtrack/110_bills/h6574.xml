	7/23/2008--Introduced.<br/>United States-Russian Federation Nuclear Cooperation Agreement Act of 2008 - States that Congress favors the United States-Russian Federation Agreement for Cooperation on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, subject to certain requirements. Prohibits the issuance of a license for the export of nuclear material, equipment, or technology to the Russian Federation unless the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that: (1) the government of the Russian Federation has taken actions to prohibit and prevent the transfer of goods, services, or technology (excluding goods, services, or technology related to the Bushehr nuclear reactor) to the government of Iran; (2) for the preceding 12-month period there has been no cooperation regarding such activities between the government or any national of the Russian Federation and the government or any national of Iran; or (3) during such 12-month period the government of the Russian Federation has terminated any significant cooperation between any Russian national and the government or any national of Iran, has instituted effective measures to prevent a reoccurrence of such cooperation, or has prosecuted any such Russian national. (Limits such certification's use to not more than two consecutive fiscal years.) Prohibits the issuance of a license for the export of nuclear material, equipment or technology to the Russian Federation unless the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of the Russian Federation: (1) is fully supporting U.S. efforts to achieve international and U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran in response to Iran's nuclear program; and (2) has ratified the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage or has enacted domestic law that provides adequate liability protections for U.S. firms for civil nuclear commerce with the Russian Federation. Terminates such license provisions five years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes the President, with specified limitations, to make extraordinary payments in connection with the International Space Station to the Russian Federal Space Agency. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require joint congressional resolution of approval of peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements.<br/>
