	9/27/2008--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Russian Federation's disproportionate military response on the sovereign territory of Georgia, including the South Ossetian Autonomous Region and the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, is in violation of international law and commitments of the Russian Federation; (2) the United States recognizes significant common interests with the Russian Federation which can serve as the basis for improved long-term relations; (3) the Russian Federation should comply with the cease-fire agreement; (4) the Russian Federation and Georgia should refrain from the future use of force to resolve the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and work with interested countries and international organizations to reach a political settlement; and (5) the United States should provide humanitarian and economic assistance to Georgia, continue to support democracy in Georgia, and work to support the free flow of energy to Europe and the operation of communication and trade routes.<br/>
