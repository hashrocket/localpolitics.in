	12/13/2007--Introduced.<br/>End Racial Profiling Act of 2007 or ERPA - Prohibits law enforcement agents or agencies from engaging in racial profiling. Defines &quot;racial profiling&quot; as the practice of a law enforcement agent or agency relying, to any degree, on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting which individual to subject to routine or spontaneous investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and substance of law enforcement activity following the initial investigatory procedure. Allows the United States, or individuals injured by racial profiling, to bring civil actions for declaratory or injunctive relief. Requires federal law enforcement agencies to: (1) maintain adequate policies and procedures for eliminating racial profiling; and (2) cease existing practices that permit racial profiling. Requires states, local governments, and Indian tribes applying for federal law enforcement assistance grants to certify that they: (1) maintain adequate policies and procedures for eliminating racial profiling; (2) have eliminated any existing practices of racial profiling; and (3) have established an administrative complaint procedure and independent auditor program for addressing complaints of racial profiling. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) carry out a two-year demonstration project to collect data on hit rates for stops and searches by law enforcement agents; (2) make grants to develop and implement best practice devices and systems to eliminate racial profiling; and (3) issue regulations for data collection and make reports on racial profiling.<br/>
