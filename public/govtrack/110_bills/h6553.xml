	7/17/2008--Introduced.<br/>Amends the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 to require the term and acreage of ski area permits for the operation of ski areas and associated facilities (under current law, for the operation of nordic and alpine ski areas and facilities) on National Forest System lands to be governed by provisions under the Act relating to such permits and other applicable law. Provides for the issuance of ski area permits for the use and occupancy of suitable lands within the National Forest System for skiing and other snow-sports and such other seasonal or year-round recreational activities associated with mountain resorts as the Secretary of Agriculture may authorize pursuant to this Act.<br/>Allows the Secretary to authorize the holder of a ski area permit issued pursuant to the Act to also provide on lands subject to such permit such other seasonal or year-round outdoor and natural-resource based developed recreation activities and associated facilities, in addition to skiing and other snow-sports, as determined appropriate.<br/>Prohibits any activity or facility from being authorized under this Act if its authorization would result in the primary recreational purpose of lands subject to a ski area permit not being skiing or other snow-sports.
