Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require a proxy, consent, or authorization for a shareholder meeting occurring on or after January 1, 2009, to permit a separate shareholder vote to approve executive compensation. States that such shareholder vote shall not be binding on the corporation or board of directors, nor construed: (1) as overruling a board decision; (2) to create or imply additional fiduciary duty by such board; (3) to restrict or limit shareholder ability to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to executive compensation.

Provides that proxy solicitation material containing such executive compensation disclosures shall require a separate shareholder vote to approve such agreements or understandings. States such a shareholder vote shall not be binding on the corporation or the board of directors, nor construed: (1) as overruling a board decision; (2) to create or imply additional fiduciary duty by such board; (3) to constrain shareholder ability to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to executive compensation.<br/>
