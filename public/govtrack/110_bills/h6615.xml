	7/24/2008--Introduced.<br/>Giving Inmate Terrorists More Opportunities (GITMO) Act of 2008 - Directs the Secretary of Defense to immediately transport all enemy combatants detained in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Washington, DC, where the U.S. Supreme Court shall hold such prisoners on Court grounds, confined by adequate fencing. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide shelter for such detainees outside the Court building, but on Court grounds; (2) provide guards; and (3) implement a system to ensure that the prisoners receive an appropriate amount of food and water. Directs detainees to use the restroom facilities inside the Court building. Allows any of the nine justices to guard the prisoners, or provide them with food and water, whenever they choose. Provides that, if either the Secretary or any of the justices refuses to carry out their duties under this Act, then their respective department or Court shall receive funding for the next fiscal year at half the level appropriated for the current fiscal year, or until such time as the Court no longer desires to micromanage the prisoners.<br/>
