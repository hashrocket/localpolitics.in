	10/4/2007--Introduced.<br/>Expanded Education Act - Amends title I of the the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to create a new part I (Expanded Education) program awarding grants to states for the conduct of separate expanded day, week, or year pilot programs. Requires that for each of the expanded day and week programs at least: (1) 20 schools in each small state and 50 schools in each large state participate; (2) 50% of each participating school's student population consist of low-income students; (3) one entire grade in each participating school be involved in the program. Requires each expanded day and week program to: (1) increase student proficiency in reading and language arts, and mathematics; (2) provide education in new areas or directions, so that it is not wholly remedial; and (3) include sufficient recreational, social, or extra-curricular cultural activities. Allows each participating state to conduct expanded year programs through one or a combination of three school-based models: (1) two to be conducted by participating schools, institutions of higher education (IHE), or nonprofit organizations in schools at least 50% of whose students are low-income students, but differing in whether they require the mandatory participation of at least one entire grade or allow the voluntary participation of at least two grades at participating schools; and (2) one requiring the state to establish a voluntary summer learning institute for low-income students at an IHE to be run by the IHE or a nonprofit organization. Requires each expanded year program to: (1) provide education in new areas or directions, or increase student expertise; (2) emphasize non-remedial work; and (3) include sufficient recreational, social, or extra-curricular cultural activities.<br/>
