	10/22/2007--Passed House amended. Denali National Park and Alaska Railroad Exchange Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant to the Alaska Railroad Corporation an exclusive use easement on land that is identified by the Secretary within Denali National Park to provide a location to the Corporation for the construction, maintenance, and on-going operation of track and associated support facilities for turning railroad trains around near Denali Park Station. Directs the Secretary, in exchange for the easement granted, to require the relinquishment of certain portions of the Corporation's existing exclusive use easement within the boundary of the Park. Requires that the acreage of the easements exchanged under this Act be approximately equal. Limits the total acreage of the easement to 25 acres. Requires the easement conveyed to the Corporation to be under the same terms as the exclusive use easement granted to the Alaska Railroad in the Park in a specified deed. States that the easement relinquished by the Corporation, respecting the portion being exchanged, shall be the full title and interest received by the Alaska Railroad in such deed. Requires the Alaska Railroad to pay all costs associated with such land exchange, including the costs of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the costs of any surveys, and other reasonable costs.<br/>Designates the lands underlying any easement relinquished to the United States under this Act that are adjacent to designated wilderness as wilderness and added to the Denali Wilderness, the boundaries of which are modified accordingly. Requires the designated lands to be managed according to the applicable provisions of the Wilderness Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980.<br/>Instructs the Secretary to require any additional terms and conditions that the Secretary determines are appropriate to protect the interests of the United States and of the Park.
