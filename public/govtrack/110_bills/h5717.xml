Authorizes the CPSC, in its sole discretion, to grant a reward up to $100,000 to any individual who provided valuable violation information which resulted in a final court order against any violators. Declares that the receipt of a reward under this section does not constitute immunity from criminal liability. Makes it unlawful to provide false information.
