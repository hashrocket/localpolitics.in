	4/1/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Encourages all Americans to: (1) pause and remember the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the 40th anniversary of his death; (2) commemorate Dr. King's legacy so that, as he hoped, &quot;one day this Nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal&quot;; and (3) remember the message of Dr. King and rededicate themselves to his goal of a free and just United States.<br/>
