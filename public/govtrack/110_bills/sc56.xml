	11/16/2007--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Joins the foreign ministers of member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that have expressed concern over the human rights situation in Burma. Encourages ASEAN to take more substantial steps to ensure Burma's peaceful transition to democracy. Urges ASEAN to ensure that all member nations live up to their membership obligations and adhere to ASEAN's core principles. States that Congress would welcome a decision by ASEAN to review Burma's ASEAN membership and to consider appropriate disciplinary measures until the government of Burma has demonstrated a commitment to human rights.
