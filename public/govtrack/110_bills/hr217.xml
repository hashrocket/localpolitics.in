	4/17/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Recognizes the 50th anniversary of the flooding of Celilo Falls, a fishing and trading location for Indian tribes near the Dalles Dam in Oregon and called the &quot;Wall Street of the West&quot; by historians, and the change of life the flooding of Celilo by the completion of the Dalles imposed upon tribal peoples.
