	3/29/2007--Introduced.<br/>Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to expand the newborns and infants hearing loss program to include diagnostic services among the services provided. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to assist in the recruitment, retention, education, and training of qualified personnel and health care providers. Includes within the purposes of such program: (1) developing efficient models to ensure that newborns and infants who are identified with a hearing loss through screening are not lost to follow-up by a qualified health care provider; and (2) ensuring an adequate supply of qualified personnel to meet the screening, evaluation, and early intervention needs of children. Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), acting through the Director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, to establish a postdoctoral fellowship program to foster research and development in the area of early hearing detection and intervention. Amends the definition of &quot;early intervention&quot; to require that families be given the opportunity to obtain the full range of early intervention services, educational and program placements, and other options for their child from highly qualified providers.<br/>
