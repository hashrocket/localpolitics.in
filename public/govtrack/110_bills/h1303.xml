	3/1/2007--Introduced.<br/>Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007 - Requires a covered airline to: (1) establish procedures for handling passenger complaints; (2) provide customers at the airport and aboard an aircraft with information regarding delay, cancellation, or diversion; (3) establish procedures to allow passengers to exit the aircraft in the case of a departure or arrival delay which would require passengers to remain on a grounded aircraft for more than three hours, with specified exceptions; (4) provide passengers on a departure- or arrival-delayed grounded aircraft with essential ventilation, food, water, sanitary, and medical services; (5) publish a monthly list of its chronically delayed flights and provide such information upon ticket purchase; (6) publish and update lowest fare and schedule information; and (7) make every reasonable effort to return lost baggage within 24 hours. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) review airline and airport emergency contingency plans for bad weather; (2) work with air carriers to ensure that a pilot operating a (long) departure delayed-flight is permitted to return the aircraft to the terminal to allow passengers to exit the aircraft without losing the flight's departure sequence position; and (3) conduct a study of the ability of air carriers to provide for passengers' essential needs in cases of diverted flights.
