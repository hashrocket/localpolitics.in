	1/4/2008--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to the term of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to: (1) provide that the five-year terms for Commissioners began with the term that commenced on November 13, 1997; (2) require subsequent terms to begin on the day after the previous term expires; and (3) permit individuals appointed to complete the unexpired term of a Commissioner to be reappointed to subsequent five-year terms. Makes such amendments effective as of the enactment of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring Reform Act of 1998 (i.e., July 22, 1998).<br/>
