	10/13/2008--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)<br/>Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to sell or exchange to the city of Norfolk, Virginia, certain real property under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including land and improvements, located in Norfolk, if the Secretary: (1) determines that such conveyance is in the best interests of NOAA and the federal government; and (2) has provided prior notification to the appropriate congressional committees.<br/>Requires the proceeds of any conveyance under this Act to be made available for: (1) activities related to the operations of, or capital improvements to, NOAA property; or (2) relocation and other costs associated with the sale or exchange. Authorizes the Secretary, through the Under Secretary and the Administrator of NOAA, to enter into a land lease with Mobile County, Alabama, for a period of not less than 40 years, on such terms and conditions as NOAA deems appropriate, for the construction of a Gulf of Mexico Disaster Response Center facility, provided that the lease is at no cost to the Government.
