	8/3/2007--Reported to House amended, Part I. Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007 - Title I: Energy Policy Act of 2005 Reforms - (Sec. 101) Instructs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to establish a cost recovery fee for applications for a permit to drill for oil and gas on federal lands administered by the Secretary. Sets forth a temporary interim fee of $1,700. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to repeal the requirement that rentals received from leases be deposited in the Treasury (in the BLM Permit Processing Improvement Fund, thus repealing authority for the Fund). (Sec. 102) Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to extend from 30 days to 90 days the deadline by which the Secretary must either issue or defer a decision on a drilling permit application. (Sec. 103) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal the deadline by which the Secretary (and additional specified Secretaries) must designate energy rights-of-way corridors on federal land. Requires the Secretaries to study and report on: (1) congestion and constraints in transmission of electricity, carbon dioxide captured from coal-fired powerplants and coal-to-liquids plants, liquid fuels derived from coal, oil, gas, and hydrogen; (2) barriers to access for transmission from renewable energy sources; and (3) the need for energy corridors on public lands to address identified congestion or constraints. Prohibits the Secretaries from designating energy corridors on public lands, and from authorizing specific rights-of-way or projects in such corridors, until the study is completed.<br/>(Sec. 104) Revises requirements governing oil shale and tar sands leasing. Instructs the Secretary to prepare an oil shale and tar sands leasing and development strategy, in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (Sec. 105) Limits the rebuttable presumption that a categorical exclusion (obviating the need for further environmental review) under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) applies to drilling an oil or gas well under the Mineral Leasing Act within a developed field for which an approved land use plan or any environmental document prepared pursuant to NEPA analyzed such drilling as a reasonably foreseeable activity. Excepts from application of such a categorical exclusion (thus subjecting to the need for further environmental review) any location or site in an area that is crucial wildlife habitat or a significant wildlife corridor. Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture, in managing their respective public lands, to adhere to Council on Environmental Quality the regulations regarding categorical exclusions. (Sec. 106) Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to amend the best management practices guidelines for oil and gas development on federal lands to: (1) require public review and comment before waiving any stipulation of an oil and gas lease (except in case of emergency); and (2) provide expedited permit review for oil and gas operators that adopt best management practices to minimize adverse impacts to wildlife habitat without seeking such a waiver. (Sec. 107) Federal Consistency Appeals Decision Refinement Act - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to increase from 160 days to 320 days the amount of time allotted to the Secretary of Commerce to compile a record of decision (ROD) used in an appeal of state consistency Title II: Federal Energy Public Accountability, Integrity, and Public Interest - Subtitle A: Accountability and Integrity in the Federal Energy Program - (Sec. 201) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to prohibit the federal government from taking royalties in-kind (as opposed to in-value), except when the oil taken in-kind is to be used for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. (Sec. 202) Instructs the Secretary to ensure that by FY2009 the Minerals Management Service shall perform at least 550 audits of oil and gas leases each fiscal year. (Sec. 203) Amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 to: (1) increase fines and penalties for underpayment or late payment of federal oil and gas royalties; (2) subject repeat violators to further tripling of the penalty, the potential for a cancellation of the lease, and a prohibition from acquiring future leases; and (3) extend the statute of limitations for oil and gas leases held by violators. Revises requirements for the sharing with states of money awarded to the federal government under civil lawsuits for the underpayment of royalties. Allows such sharing with the Land and Water Conservation Fund (for offshore lease violations). Subtitle B: Amendments to Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 - (Sec. 212) Repeals the requirement that the federal government pay interest on royalty overpayments made by operators. (Sec. 213) Obligates any lessee that makes a royalty adjustment resulting in an underpayment to repay that amount (plus interest) from the date the adjustment is made (thus extending the statute of limitations on that royalty payment). (Sec. 214) Allows the Secretary to correspond only with a lease designee in the case of subpoenas or agreements to pause the statute of limitations. (Currently, the Secretary must contact in writing each lessee individually (that has designated that designee). (Sec. 215) Subjects to liability for royalty payments a designee who pays the royalty obligation on behalf the lessee. Subtitle C: Public Interest in the Federal Energy Program - (Sec. 221) Requires the operator and surface owners to file a signed document with the Secretary that the operator has secured a written surface use agreement with the surface estate owner as a prerequisite to exploration and drilling operations on lands with federal title to oil and gas resources, but not federal ownership of the surface estate. Sets conditions for authorizing exploration and drilling operations without a surface use agreement. Permits a surface estate owner to petition the Secretary for payment of a bond or other financial assurance required as compensation for damages resulting from exploration and drilling operations. Prescribes requirements for specified notifications to surface estate owners. (Sec. 222) Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to set forth reclamation requirements governing: (1) oil or gas production (including coalbed methane) under a lease; (2) reclamation bonds or other financial assurances; and (3) remediation or replacement of any lost or contaminated surface or groundwater supply to water users. (Sec. 224) Instructs the Secretary to issue regulations to establish a $1 per acre annual due diligence fee governing federal onshore lands subject to a lease for production of oil, natural gas, or coal under which production is not occurring. Requires the availability of collected fees for the Healthy Lands Initiative to restore federal lands and resources damaged by oil and gas development. Makes such funds also available for coal-to-liquids programs or pilot projects.

Title III: Alternative Energy and Efficiency - (Sec. 301) Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to eligible coastal states to support voluntary state efforts to initiate and complete surveys of portions of coastal state waters and federal waters adjacent to a state's coastal zone to identify potential areas suitable or unsuitable for the exploration, development, and production of alternative energy consistent with the enforceable policies of coastal management plans. Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to a coastal state the demonstrates the grant will be used to develop an alternative energy survey. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate and report to Congress on the potential for developing rights-of-way along Bureau of Reclamation canals and infrastructure for solar or wind energy production through leasing of lands or other means.
