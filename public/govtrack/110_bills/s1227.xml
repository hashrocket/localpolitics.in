	4/26/2007--Introduced.<br/>Clean Coal Act of 2007 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require a new coal-fired electric generating unit (including a cogeneration facility) that commences construction on or after April 26, 2007, to meet, without interruption throughout the lifetime operation of the unit, a standard of performance that, at a minimum, requires the unit to produce not more than 285 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour for supply to the grid.<br/>Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise such standard to reduce the maximum rate of carbon dioxide emissions if a reduced level is achievable through the application of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction demonstrated at the time of the revision.<br/>Provides that carbon dioxide that is injected into a geological formation in a manner that prevents the release of the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere shall not be counted as emissions discharged from a unit for purposes of meeting the standard.<br/>
