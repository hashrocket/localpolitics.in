(Sec. 3) Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012 for grants for demonstration programs to evaluate the effectiveness of screening, counseling, or health care services in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by heritable disorders in newborns and children.<br/>(Sec. 4) Expands the duties of the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to include: (1) making recommendations that include the heritable disorders for which all newborns should be screened; (2) developing a model decision-matrix for newborn screening expansion; and (3) considering ways to ensure that all states attain the capacity to screen for the recommended conditions. Sets forth deadlines for the Secretary to make a decision on Advisory Committee recommendations.<br/>Requires the Advisory Committee to continue to operate during the five-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.<br/>(Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to establish and maintain a central clearinghouse of current information on newborn screening.
