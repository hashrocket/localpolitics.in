	1/24/2007--Introduced.<br/>Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) to: (1) define &quot;fuel products&quot; to mean petroleum products and alternative fuels, including ethanol and biodiesel; (2) redesignate the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as the Strategic Fuels Reserve; and (3) rename the SPR Petroleum Account as the SFR Fuel Account. (Thus brings such alternative fuels within the purview of EPCA).<br/>
