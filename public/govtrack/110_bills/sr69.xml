	2/17/2007--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Recognizes that African American spirituals are a poignant and powerful genre of music that have become one of the most significant segments of American music in existence. Encourages the people of the United States to reflect on the important contribution of African-American spirituals to U.S. history and to recognize the African-American spiritual as a national treasure.
