	7/23/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Recognizes the 20th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and its impact upon hundreds of thousands of homeless men, women, children, and youth in the United States, including the substantial contributions of Representatives Stewart B. McKinney and Bruce Vento in addressing homelessness. Supports the efforts of federal, state, and local governments and private non-profit organizations to prevent and end homelessness through the development of affordable housing, including efforts to prevent and end homelessness among armed forces veterans. Commends the dedication and commitment of service providers, including faith-based and nonprofit organizations, to end homelessness in their communities and provide emergency food, shelter, and services to homeless Americans. Declares that the House of Representatives endeavors to work with the same courage, dignity, and determination exemplified by Representatives McKinney and Vento to eliminate homelessness in the United States.<br/>
