	6/30/2008--Public Law. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to accept, as part of a settlement of any alleged violations of environmental law, diesel emissions reduction Supplemental Environmental Projects if the projects: (1) protect human health or the environment; (2) are related to the underlying alleged violations; (3) do not constitute activities that the defendant would otherwise be legally required to perform; and (4) do not provide funds for EPA's staff or for contractors to carry out EPA's internal operations.<br/>Directs the Administrator, in any such settlement agreement, to require the defendant to include in the settlement documents a certification under penalty of law that the defendant would have agreed to perform a comparably valued, alternative project other than a diesel emissions reduction Supplemental Environmental Project if the Administrator were precluded by law from accepting a diesel emission reduction Supplemental Environmental Project. States that failure by the Administrator to include this language shall not create a cause of action against the United States under the Clean Air Act or any other law or create a basis for overturning a settlement agreement entered into by the United States.<br/>Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include the District of Columbia as a state for purposes of grant programs for diesel emission reductions.<br/>
