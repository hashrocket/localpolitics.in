Requires deposit into the Treasury of all revenues and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets.<br/>(Sec. 107) Authorizes the Secretary to waive specific provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation if urgent and compelling circumstances make compliance with them contrary to the public interest. Requires submission of such a waiver, and its justification, to certain congressional oversight committees.<br/>Requires the Secretary, in any solicitation or contract containing such a waiver, to develop and implement standards and procedures to ensure the inclusion and utilization of minorities and women, and minority- and women-owned businesses, in that solicitation or contract, including contracts to asset managers, servicers, property managers, and other service providers or expert consultants.<br/>Makes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) eligible for, and requires its consideration in, the selection of asset managers for residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities.

Authorizes the Secretary to use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures.<br/>(Sec. 110) Directs federal property managers (the Federal Housing Finance Agency, as conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the FDIC, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), to the extent that they hold, own, or control mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and other assets secured by residential real estate, including multifamily housing, to implement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners and use its authority to encourage the servicers of the underlying mortgages to take advantage of the HOPE for Homeowners Program or other available programs to minimize foreclosures.<br/>(Sec. 111) Subjects any financial institution that sells troubled assets to the Secretary to specified executive compensation requirements.<br/>Directs the Secretary to require a financial institution to meet appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance whenever: (1) the purposes of this Act are best met through direct purchases of troubled assets from an individual financial institution where no bidding process or market prices are available; and (2) the Secretary receives a meaningful equity or debt position in the financial institution as a result of the transaction.<br/>Requires such standards to include: (1) limits on compensation that exclude incentives for senior executive officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the financial institution's value during the period the Secretary holds an equity or debt position in it; (2) a provision for the recovery by the financial institution of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive officer based on statements of earnings, gains, or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; and (3) a prohibition on the institution's making any golden parachute payment to its senior executive officer during the period that the Secretary holds an equity or debt position in the financial institution.<br/>Requires the Secretary, upon a determination that specified auction purchases of troubled assets best meet the purposes of this Act, to prohibit, for certain financial institutions, any new employment contract with a senior executive officer that provides a golden parachute in the event of an involuntary termination, bankruptcy filing, insolvency, or receivership.<br/>(Sec. 112) Instructs the Secretary to coordinate with foreign financial authorities and central banks to work toward the establishment of similar programs by such authorities and central banks.<br/>States that, to the extent the foreign entities hold troubled assets as a result of extending financing to financial institutions that have failed or defaulted on such financing, such troubled assets qualify for purchase under this title.<br/>(Sec. 113) Prescribes requirements for purchase and sale of assets by the Secretary, using market mechanisms, in a manner that will minimize any potential long-term negative impact on the taxpayer.<br/>(Sec. 114) Requires the Secretary to: (1) make available to the public a description, amounts, and pricing of assets acquired under this Act within two business days of purchase, trade, or other disposition; and (2) determine whether the disclosure required of financial institutions that sell troubled assets to the Secretary with respect to off-balance sheet transactions, derivatives instruments, contingent liabilities, and similar sources of potential exposure adequately provides sufficient information to the public regarding the true financial position of the institutions (market transparency).<br/>Requires the Secretary to recommend additional disclosure requirements to the relevant regulators if disclosure pursuant to this market transparency requirement is not adequate for that purpose.<br/>(Sec. 115) Limits the Secretary's authority to purchase troubled assets under this Act to: (1) $250 billion outstanding at any one time; (2) $350 billion outstanding at any one time if, at any time, the President certifies to Congress that the Secretary needs to exercise authority for up to such an amount; and (3) $700 billion outstanding at any one time if, at any time after such a certification, the President reports to Congress a plan of the Secretary to exercise the authority authority for up to such an amount, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval within 15 calendar days of transmission of the plan.<br/>Requires a joint resolution of disapproval to receive fast track consideration in the House and the Senate.<br/>(Sec. 116) Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) perform ongoing oversight of TARP activities and performance and its agents and representatives, including vehicles established by the Secretary under this Act;
