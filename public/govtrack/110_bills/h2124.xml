	5/3/2007--Introduced.<br/>Federal Agency Data Breach Protection Act - Amends federal law governing public printing and documents to instruct the Director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish policies, procedures, and standards for agencies to follow in the event of a breach of data security involving disclosure of sensitive personal information for which harm to an individual could reasonably be expected to result. Requires such policies and procedures to include: (1) timely notification to individuals whose sensitive personal information could be compromised as a result of a breach; (2) guidance on determining how to provide timely notice; and (3) guidance regarding whether additional special actions are necessary and appropriate, including data breach analysis, fraud resolution services, identity theft insurance, and credit protection or monitoring services. Authorizes each agency Chief Information Officer to: (1) enforce data breach policies; and (2) develop an inventory of all personal computers, laptops, or any other hardware containing sensitive personal information. Requires federal agency information security programs to include data breach notification procedures to alert individuals whose sensitive personal information is compromised. Makes it the duty of each agency Chief Human Capital Officer to prescribe policies and procedures for employee exit interviews, including a full accounting of all federal personal property assigned to the employee during the course of employment.
