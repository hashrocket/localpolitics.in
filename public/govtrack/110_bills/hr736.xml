	10/16/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Recognizes and honors the: (1) contributions of scientists and engineers of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)and its partners who pioneered the technologies to enable supersonic flight; and (2) bravery of Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Yeager and the many other test pilots who, sometimes at the cost of their lives, enabled the aeronautics developments that made possible the first supersonic flight on October 14, 1947.<br/>
