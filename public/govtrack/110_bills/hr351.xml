	5/1/2007--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) federal authorities should use all tools at their disposal to strengthen and enforce immigration laws; (2) the policy of certain cities and other political subdivisions of providing sanctuary to illegal aliens encourages illegal immigration; (3) state and local law enforcement officials should report immigration violations to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); (4) Congress should reject legislation which would grant amnesty to illegal aliens currently residing in the United States until all existing immigration laws are enforced; and (5) federal immigration laws must be enforced to ensure the integrity of our immigration system and the sovereignty of our nation.<br/>
