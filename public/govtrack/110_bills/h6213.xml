	6/9/2008--Introduced.<br/>Reinsurance International Solvency Standards Evaluation Board Act of 2008 - Establishes the Reinsurance International Solvency Standards Evaluation Board to evaluate reinsurance supervisory systems of the states and jurisdictions outside the United States to determine, on a uniform basis, whether such systems provide adequate capital and risk management standards and an acceptable level of prudential supervision over their domiciled reinsurers. Requires the Board to: (1) establish evaluation standards and procedures for requesting an evaluation; and (2) develop uniform standards to improve reinsurance regulation, particularly where a domestic or international consensus standard or conflict of law has emerged. Prohibits the domiciliary state of a ceding insurer, for the purpose of determining credit for reinsurance for the ceding insurer, from treating a certified reinsurer domiciled and in good standing in any other domestic or foreign jurisdiction differently from reinsurers domiciled and in good standing in such domiciliary state.
