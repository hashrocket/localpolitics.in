	1/29/2008--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Commends the Kenyan people for their commitment to democracy, as evidenced by the high voter turnout and peaceful voting on election day. Condemns: (1) the violence in Kenya; and (2) threats to civil leaders and human rights activists. Urges politicians and political parties to desist from the deactivation and use of ethnic militias. Calls on the two leading presidential candidates to engage in an internationally brokered dialogue and respect the will of the Kenyan people. Calls for: (1) those who are found guilty of human rights violations to be held accountable for their actions; and (2) an end to restrictions on the media and on the rights of peaceful assembly and association. Calls on the international community, U.N. aid organizations, and neighboring countries to provide assistance to Kenyan refugees and to use all diplomatic means to persuade relevant political actors to commit to peacefully resolving the current crisis. Urges the President of the United States to: (1) support diplomatic efforts to facilitate a Kenyan dialogue; (2) consider imposing personal sanctions on leaders and other relevant actors who refuse to engage in meaningful dialogue to end the current crisis; and (3) restrict U.S. nonessential assistance to Kenya unless all parties are able to peacefully resolve the current crisis.<br/>
