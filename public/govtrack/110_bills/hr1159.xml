	<summary>
	9/9/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Recognizes the historical and educational significance of the USS Constellation, a 153-year-old American warship berthed in Baltimore, Maryland, as a reminder of both American participation in the slave trade and U.S. efforts to suppress this inhumane practice. Applauds the vessel's preservation and the USS Constellation Museum's efforts regarding this part of our history. Supports the USS Constellation as an appropriate site to commemorate the bicentennial of transatlantic slave trade abolition.<br/>
