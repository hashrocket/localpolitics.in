Title II: Airport Improvements - (Sec. 201) Revises passenger facility charge (PFC) provisions granting an eligible agency (a public agency that controls a commercial service airport) the authority to impose a PFC on passengers boarding an aircraft, including requiring such agency to: (1) submit annually to air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at the airport, and make available to the public, a status report on the agency's PFC program; and (2) obtain approval from the Secretary before imposing a PFC to finance an intermodal ground access project or increasing a PFC. (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary to establish and conduct an alternative PFC collection pilot program under which an eligible agency may impose a PFC without regard to dollar amount limitations, provided such agency collects the PFC from a passenger at the airport via the Internet, or in any other reasonable manner.
