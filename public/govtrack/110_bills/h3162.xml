	8/1/2007--Reported to House amended, Part I. Children's Health and Medicare Protection (CHAMP) Act of 2007 - Title I: Children's Health Insurance Program - (Sec. 100) States that it is the purpose of this title to provide dependable and stable funding for children's health insurance under titles XXI (Children's Health Insurance Program) (CHIP) (also known as SCHIP) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) in order to enroll all six million uninsured children who are eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage today. Subtitle A: Funding - (Sec. 101) Prescribes formulae for new base CHIP allotments for states and territories beginning with FY2008. (Sec. 102) Makes CHIP allotments for FY2008 and each following fiscal year available for two years only (currently three years). (Sec. 103) Provides for redistribution of unused allotments to address state funding shortfalls. (Sec. 104) Increases from 20% to 30% the percentage of any CHIP allotment that a state may use for Medicaid payments after FY2007. Subtitle B: Improving Enrollment and Retention of Eligible Children - (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make performance bonus payments to states to offset the additional Medicaid and CHIP child enrollment costs resulting from enrollment and retention efforts. (Sec. 112) Gives states the option to provide that, in determining a child's Medicaid eligibility, it may rely on a finding made within a reasonable period from an Express Lane agency. Requires the state to use its regular procedures to determine Medicaid eligibility, however, if the Express Lane finding is negative. Authorizes a federal or state agency or private entity possessing sources of data potentially pertinent to Medicaid eligibility determinations to convey such data to the state agency administering the state Medicaid plan, subject to specified requirements. (Sec. 113)Applies Medicaid outreach procedures to all children and pregnant women. (Sec. 114) Requires payments to states to cover translation or interpretation services in connection with the enrollment and retention under Medicaid of children of families for whom English is not the primary language. Provides for the use of community health workers for outreach activities. Subtitle C: Coverage - (Sec. 121) Requires the child health assistance provided to a targeted low-income child to cover dental services, federally-qualified health center (FQHC) services, and rural health clinic (RHC) services. (Sec. 122) Revises the definition of both CHIP and Medicaid: (1) Secretary-approved coverage, relating to child health assistance to a targeted low-income child, to require the health benefits coverage to be at least equivalent to the coverage in a benchmark benefit package; and (2) state employee benchmark coverage to be that selected most frequently by employees seeking dependent coverage in either of the previous two plan years. (Sec. 123) Establishes a 30-day premium grace period for state child health plans. Subtitle D: Populations - (Sec. 131) Provides for optional coverage of older children, up to age 25, under Medicaid and CHIP. (Sec. 132) Provides for optional coverage of legal immigrants under Medicaid and CHIP. (Sec. 133) Gives states the option to expand or add coverage of targeted low-income pregnant women under CHIP. (Sec. 134) Prohibits the Secretary, through exercise of waiver authority, from providing for federal financial participation to a state for CHIP health care services for individuals who are not targeted low-income children or pregnant women, unless the Secretary determines that no eligible targeted low-income child in the state would be denied such coverage because of such eligibility. Subtitle E: Access - (Sec. 141) Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to establish as an agency of Congress the Children's Access, Payment, and Equality Commission to review federal and state payment policies of the Medicaid and CHIP programs and make pertinent recommendations to Congress. (Sec. 142) Directs the Comptroller General to develop, and report to Congress on, a model process for the coordination of Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, retention, and coverage of children who, because of migration of families, emergency evacuations, educational needs, or otherwise, frequently change their state of residency or otherwise are temporarily located outside of the state of their residency. (Sec. 143) Gives states the option to require children to present satisfactory documentary evidence of proof of U.S. citizenship or nationality for Medicaid eligibility purposes. (Sec. 144) Directs the Secretary to develop a program to deliver oral health educational materials that inform new parents about risks for, and prevention of, early childhood caries and the need for a dental visit within their newborn's first year of life. Prohibits a state from preventing an FQHC from contracting with private practice dental providers in the provision of FQHC services. (Sec. 145) Prohibits the Secretary from approving any new health opportunity account demonstration programs. Subtitle F: Quality and Program Integrity - (Sec. 151) Requires the Secretary to establish a child health care quality measurement program to develop and implement pediatric quality measures for children's health care, as well as overall program performance measures, that may be used by public and private health care purchasers. (Sec. 152) Requires any state child health plan to apply to CHIP coverage, state agencies, enrollment brokers, and managed care entities and organizations certain managed care quality safeguards that apply to such coverage and entities under Medicaid. (Sec. 153) Directs the Secretary to conduct an independent subsequent evaluation of 10 states with approved child health plans. (Sec. 154) Grants access to CHIP records for Inspector General and General Accounting Office audits and evaluation. Title II: Medicare Beneficiary Improvements - Subtitle A: Improvements in Benefits - (Sec. 202) Amends SSA title XVIII (Medicare) to provide coverage of, and waiver of cost-sharing for, specified preventive services. Eliminates coinsurance in outpatient hospital settings and waives application of any deductible for all preventive services, as well as medical nutrition therapy services. (Sec. 202) Revises requirements for payments from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. Waives the deductible for colorectal cancer screening tests regardless of coding, subsequent diagnosis, or ancillary tissue removal. (Sec. 203) Eliminates the 62 1/2% limitation on payments for outpatient treatment of mental disorders (thus requiring parity of payments for mental health coinsurance). Subtitle B: Improving, Clarifying, and Simplifying Financial Assistance for Low Income Medicare Beneficiaries - (Sec. 211) Provides that, beginning in 2009, the maximum resources level shall be the same for both part D low-income subsidy (LIS) groups. Sets such level in 2009 at $17,000 for an individual and $34,000 for a couple, and in subsequent years at the previous year's level increased by $1,000 for an individual and $2,000 for a couple. Applies such maximum resource levels also to eligibility determination for Medicare Savings programs. (Sec. 212) Revises requirements for the program under which individuals qualifying for Medicare (QIs) also qualify for Medicaid. Repeals the termination date for the QI program to make the program permanent. Eliminates the funding limitation, thereby expanding eligibility to all persons meeting the income and resource criteria. Provides a 100% federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for payments under the QI program. Sets the resources standard for the QI program at 150% of the federal poverty level. (Sec. 213) Requires that persons applying for the part D LIS program be permitted to qualify on the basis of self-certification of income and resources without the need to provide additional documentation. Requires that a subsidy eligible individual (or particular class, such as a full or partial subsidy individual) be deemed to continue to be eligible without the need for any annual or periodic application (automatic reenrollment), unless and until the individual notifies a responsible federal or state official that the eligibility conditions have changed so that the individual is no longer subsidy eligible. Requires the Secretary to take all reasonable steps to encourage states to provide, under the Medicare Savings Program (MSP), for such administrative verification of income and automatic reenrollment. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to provide Medicare part A benefit applicants information describing the MSP and the LIS program (LISP), applications for LISP for medical assistance for Medicare cost-sharing, as well as information on how to obtain assistance in completing such applications. Requires the Commissioner to: (1) make such application forms available at local Social Security Administration (SS Admin) offices; and (2) provide training to SS Admin employees in assisting applicants in completing an MSP application. Requires the state Medicaid agency to accept MSP applications and act on them in the same manner, and subject to the same deadlines, as if they had been submitted directly by the applicant. Requires the Secretary to translate the Model Form used for MSP applications into at least 10 languages that are most often used by persons applying for Social Security or Medicare part A benefits. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the disclosure of tax return information to SS Admin officers and employees for purposes of providing low-income subsidies under Medicare. (Sec. 214) Prohibits any estate recovery of Medicaid correctly paid for Medicare cost-sharing or related benefits on behalf of an individual who was 55 years of age or older when the individual received such medical assistance. (Sec. 215) Eliminates part D cost-sharing for certain non-institutionalized full-benefit dual eligible mentally retarded individuals. (Sec. 216) Excludes from calculation of income and resources for LIS eligibility the value of any life insurance policy or any balance in a pension or retirement plan. (Sec. 217) Limits the aggregate cost-sharing per year for LIS-eligible individuals to 2.5% of income. (Sec. 218) Prohibits the automatic enrollment of a part D eligible individual in a prescription drug plan unless the plan meets specified formulary, pharmacy network, quality, and low cost requirements. Subtitle C: Part D Beneficiary Improvements - (Sec. 221) Revises requirements for the annual out-of-pocket threshold that part D beneficiaries must meet for any costs incurred by AIDS drug assistance programs and the Indian Health Service. (Sec. 222) Permits a special enrollment period in the case of an individual enrolled in a prescription drug plan (PDP) or Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan who has been prescribed a covered part D drug while so enrolled, if the formulary of the plan is materially changed (in midyear, and other than because of a Food and Drug Administration recall or withdrawal) in a way to reduce the drug coverage (or increase the cost-sharing). (Sec. 223) Repeals the exclusion of benzodiazepines from required part D drug coverage (thus extending coverage to such drugs). (Sec. 224) Authorizes the Secretary to apply to part D the same process for updating drug compendia as used under Medicare part B. (Sec. 225) Requires PDP formularies to include all or substantially all covered part D drugs in the therapeutic classes: (1) anticonvulsants; (2) antineoplastics; (3) antiretrovirals; (4) antidepressants; (5) antipsychotics; and (6) immunosuppressants. (Sec. 226) Eliminates part D late enrollment penalties for LIS-eligible individuals. (Sec. 227) Creates a special enrollment period for LIS-eligible individuals, together with automatic enrollment for those who fail to enroll in a PDP or MA-PD plan during such period. Subtitle D: Reducing Health Disparities - (Sec. 231) Directs the Secretary to: (1) collect data on the race, ethnicity, and primary language of each Medicare benefits applicant and recipient; (2) analyze and report on such data annually to the Director of the Office for Civil Rights and specified congressional committees; and (3) ensure that the provision of assistance to an applicant or recipient of assistance is not denied or otherwise adversely affected because of the failure of the applicant or recipient to provide race, ethnicity, and primary language data. (Sec. 232) Directs the Secretary to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on ways that Medicare should develop payment systems for language services using the results of Sec. 233 demonstration programs to improve effective communication between Medicare service providers and Medicare beneficiaries who are limited English proficient. (Sec. 233) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, to award 24 three-year grants to eligible Medicare service providers to conduct such demonstration programs. (Sec. 234) Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration project to determine the greatest needs and most effective methods of outreach to Medicare beneficiaries who were previously uninsured. (Sec. 235) Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to report on: (1) the extent to which Medicare providers and plans are complying with the Office for Civil Rights' Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding the Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons, and the Office of Minority Health's Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Service Standards in health care; and (2) a description of the costs associated with or savings related to the provision of language services. Directs the Department of Health and Human Services to implement changes responsive to any deficiencies identified in the report. (Sec. 236) Requires the Secretary to seek to arrange with the Institute of Medicine to report on the impact of language access services on the health and health care of limited English proficient populations. Title III: Physicians' Service Payment Reform - (Sec. 301) Amends SSA title XVIII (Medicare) to require establishment of: (1) separate target growth rates for service categories; (2) separate conversion factors for each service category; and (3) updates for such conversion factors. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish an expert panel to identify misvalued physicians' services; and (2) conduct a five-year review of physicians' services in conjunction with the five-year review by the American Medical Association/Specialty Society Relative Value Update Committee (RUC), particularly for services that have experienced substantial changes in length of stay, site of service, volume, practice expense, or other factors that may indicate changes in physician work. Gives the Secretary the authority to reduce the work component for services with accelerated growth without using the RUC process. (Sec. 303) Requires the Secretary to develop a mechanism to measure resource use on a per capita and an episode basis in order to provide confidential feedback to physicians in the Medicare program on how their practice patterns compare to physicians generally, both in the same locality as well as nationally. (Sec. 304) Creates incentive payments under the Medicare program for participating physicians practicing in an efficient area. (Sec. 305) Directs the Comptroller General to analyze and report to Congress on: (1) codes paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule to determine whether the codes for procedures that are commonly furnished together should be combined; and (2) those procedures under the same schedule for which no global payment methodology is applied but for which a &quot;bundled&quot; payment methodology would be appropriate. (Sec. 306) Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) an expanded medical home demonstration project; and (2) a process for selection of a qualified standard setting and certification organization to establish standards for medical practices to qualify as medical homes or as HIT-enhanced medical homes. Requires the Secretary to provide for payment to the personal physician of each participating beneficiary of a monthly medical home care management fee. (Sec. 307) Repeals the Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative Fund. (Sec. 308) Requires the Secretary to revise the fee schedule areas for California for services furnished on or after January 1, 2008 using a specified proposed county-based geographic adjustment factor. (Sec. 309) Requires diagnostic imaging services to be furnished at an accredited facility in order to be covered by the part B physicians' services fee schedule. Provides for the adjustment in practice expenses to reflect a higher presumed utilization of such imaging services. Requires the Secretary to adjust the number of practice expense relative value units for imaging services to reflect a 75%, rather than a 50%, presumed rate of utilization. Directs the Secretary to increase from 25% to 50% the reduction in expenditures (&quot;discount&quot;) attributable to the multiple procedure payment reduction applicable to the technical component for single-session imaging involving consecutive body parts under a specified final rule published by the Secretary in the Federal Register. Directs the Secretary, in computing the practice expense component for imaging services, to change the interest rate assumption for capital purchases of imaging devices to reflect the prevailing rate in the market, but in no case higher than 11%. Prohibits the Secretary from accepting or paying a claim for imaging unless it is made separately for each component of such services. (Thus disallows global billing.) (Sec. 310) Reduces the frequency of meetings of the Practicing Physicians Advisory Council from once each quarter to once a year. Title IV: Medicare Advantage Reforms - Subtitle A: Payment Reform - (Sec. 401) Revises requirements for Medicare Advantage (MA) rates for monthly capitation payments to the MA plans, currently set by a process based on county level benchmarks and MA plan bids. Requires phase-out of payments to MA plans in excess of 100% of the average Fee-for-Service (FFS) costs in each county over four years to 100% of the FFS cost in the county in 2011. Prescribes a formula for blended county benchmarks and FFS to accomplish this goal. Excludes indirect medical education (IME) costs from the calculation of the 100% FFS for an MA plan in a county area. Provides that, if a MA plan bid exceeds 106% of the county FFS amount for 2009 or 103% of the FFS amount in 2010, then that MA plan may not enroll any new enrollees for that year during the annual, coordinated election period or during the year (if the enrollment becomes effective during the year). Requires FFS rates to be rebased annually beginning in 2009. Repeals the regional Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) stabilization fund. Subtitle B: Beneficiary Protections - (Sec. 411) Requests the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to develop and submit to the Secretary model regulations regarding Medicare plan marketing, enrollment, broker and agent training and certification, agent and broker commissions, and market conduct by plans, agents and brokers. Prescribes general guidelines for such regulations. Declares that any contract with an MA organization shall require it to meet all marketing and enrollment standards adopted pursuant to such NAIC model regulations, subject to specified sanctions. Doubles the civil monetary penalties that may be imposed on an MA organization that violates its contract. Requires the Secretary to: (1) disclose on the HHS public website all market and advertising contract violations and imposed sanctions; and (2) develop standard definitions of benefits and formats for use in marketing materials. Specifies funding to support Medicare part C and part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) counseling and assistance provided by State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs). (Sec. 412) Requires Medicare part C (private) plans to offer benefits under the original Medicare FFS program option with cost-sharing requirements no greater than those imposed under the traditional Medicare program. States that nothing shall be construed as prohibiting Medicare part C plans from using flat co-payments or per diem rates in lieu of part A or part B cost-sharing amounts, as long as they do not exceed the level of cost-sharing under traditional Medicare. Prohibits Medicare part C plans from imposing cost-sharing for dual-eligible individuals or qualified Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare part C plan that exceeds the cost-sharing amounts permitted under the Medicare and Medicaid statutes. (Sec. 413) Authorizes continuous open enrollment in Medicare part C plans for full benefit dual-eligible individuals and qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs). Changes the continuous open enrollment period to allow institutionalized, dual-eligible individuals and QMBs to disenroll from MA plans and return to traditional Medicare at any time. Authorizes special election periods for specified low-income Medicare beneficiaries and beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare part C plans in which enrollment has been suspended for not meeting the terms of their contracts. Requires the Secretary to take into account the health or well-being of the individual when determining the exceptional conditions in which individuals may be allowed to take advantage of a special election period. Increases from one year to two years the length of time certain categories of individuals who leave Medicare part C plans have to enroll in a Medigap plan. Prohibits the Secretary from enrolling Medicaid-eligible individuals (automatically) as dual-eligibles or QMBs in a Medicare part C plan without the individual's affirmative enrollment application. (Sec. 414) Directs the Secretary to publish for each Medicare part C plan: (1) its medical loss ratio in the previous year: (2) the per enrollee payment to the plan, as adjusted to reflect a risk score of 1.0; and (3) the average risk score (as so based). Prescribes requirements for preparation of the data necessary for such information, including standardized data elements and definitions. Requires a contract with a Medicare part C organization to provide the Secretary with the right to audit and inspect any pertinent book or record. Provides that, beginning in 2010, if an MA plan fails to have a medical loss ratio of at least .85, it will be subject to the following sanctions: (1) reduction of the blended benchmark amount; (2) no new enrollees for a specified period of time; and (3) termination of the plan contract if the plan fails to have such a medical loss for five consecutive contract years. Directs the Secretary to publish monthly the actual enrollment in each Medicare part C plan by contract and county. Requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to study and report to Congress on the need and feasibility of providing for different minimum medical loss ratios for different types of Medicare part C plans. Subtitle C: Quality and Other Provisions - (Sec. 421) Requires any Medicare Advantage organization offering a private fee-for-service plan or an MSA plan for contract year 2009 to submit to the Secretary the same information on the same performance measures for which such information must be submitted for Medicare part C plans that are PPO plans for that year. Requires any such Medicare Advantage organization for contract year 2010 to submit to the Secretary the same performance measure information for which such information must be submitted for coordinated Medicare part C plans for that year. Requires employer-sponsored Medicare part C plans to have 90% of the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the plan reside in a county in which the organization offers a Medicare part C local plan. (Sec. 422) Requires the Secretary to develop quality measures for Medicare part C plans that measure disparities in the amount and quality of health services provided to racial and ethnic minorities. Requires the Secretary to provide for Medicare part C organizations to submit data that permits analysis of such disparities, together with biennial reports to Congress on how quality assurance programs measure and report on them. (Sec. 423) Requires Medicare Advantage plan audits to cover plan information submitted for risk adjustment purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to take actions, including pursuit of financial recoveries, necessary to address deficiencies identified in an audit or other activities. Applies such authority of the Secretary to PDPs under Medicare part D. (Sec. 424) Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the adequacy of the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment system. (Sec. 425) Eliminates the providers' ability to bill enrollees in private fee-for-service plans more than the Medicare fee schedule amount. Repeals the exemption of private FFA plans from the Secretary's authority to review and negotiate Medicare Advantage plan bid amounts. (Thus authorizes the Secretary to review and negotiate the bid amounts for private FFS plans in the same manner as with other Medicare part C plans.) (Sec. 426) Renames the Medicare Advantage program as the Medicare part C program. Subtitle D: Extension of Authorities - (Sec. 431) Extends the authority to limit enrollment in special needs plans to only special needs beneficiaries for periods before January 1, 2012.
