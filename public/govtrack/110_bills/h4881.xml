	4/14/2008--Passed House amended. (This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on April 10, 2008. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2008 - Establishes a policy that no U.S. government contracts or grants should be awarded to individuals or companies with seriously delinquent tax debts.<br/>Requires a person who has such a debt to be proposed for debarment from any federal government contract unless such requirement is waived by a federal agency head. Requires an agency head that issues an invitation for bids or a request for proposals for a contract in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold to require prospective contractors to: (1) certify that they do not have such a debt; and (2) authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose information describing whether they have such a debt. Exempts contracts designated by agency heads as assisting the agency in the performance of disaster relief authorities or as necessary to national security.<br/>Prohibits the head of an agency offering a grant exceeding such threshold from awarding it to a person who does not submit such certification and authorization. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation and regulations governing grants to be revised to require such certification and authorization. Defines &quot;seriously delinquent tax debt&quot; as an outstanding tax debt for which a notice of lien has been filed in public records. Excludes a tax debt: (1) that is being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an installment agreement; or (2) for which a collection due process hearing, or for which relief from liability for a tax deficiency applicable to joint filers, is requested or pending.<br/>
