	<summary>
	11/5/2007--Passed House amended. Expresses concern over the emerging national security implications of Iran's efforts to expand its influence in Latin America. Supports the existing counterterrorism efforts of Latin American countries, including the successful counterterrorism efforts of the 3+1 Group (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and the United States). Emphasizes the importance of eliminating Hizbollah's financial network in the tri-border region of South America. Commends the efforts of individual countries and regional bodies in the Western Hemisphere that have led efforts to eliminate terrorist financing and other terrorist operations. Urges the U.S. government to work with countries in the Western Hemisphere to help them create antiterrorism legislation. Recommends that the President of the United States create more mechanisms for joint counterterrorism operations and intraregional information sharing among supportive countries in the Western Hemisphere, especially in light of Iran's increased regional involvement.<br/>
