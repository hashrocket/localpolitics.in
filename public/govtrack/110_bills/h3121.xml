	5/13/2008--Passed Senate amended. Title I: Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization - Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2008 - (Sec. 104) Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (Act) to extend the national flood insurance program (Program) though FY2013. (Sec. 105) Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make national flood insurance available for multifamily properties of more than four units to a maximum coverage equal to the coverage amount made available to commercial properties. (Sec. 106) Requires the FEMA Director to estimate the exclusion of certain prospective insureds from purchasing flood insurance at risk premium rates less than those estimated for specified properties (including any property not an individual's primary residence, severe repetitive loss property, and any business property). Sets an annual risk premium rate limitation of 25% for such properties. Prohibits the Director from providing flood insurance to prospective insureds at risk premium rates less than those otherwise estimated (federal subsidy) for new or lapsed policies, or to any prospective insured who refuses to accept any offer for FEMA mitigation assistance by the Administrator. Increases from 10% to 15% the annual limitation on risk premium rate increases for any properties within any single risk classification. (Sec. 107) Instructs FEMA to issue final regulations establishing revised definitions of special flood hazard areas, including residual risk areas. Subjects such areas to mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements. Requires the Director to ensure that the flood insurance policy price in residual risk areas accurately reflects the level of flood protection provided by any levee, dam, or other the man-made structure in the area. Requires the Army Corps of Engineers to notify the Director of the National Flood Insurance Program immediately upon decertification of any levee, dam, or man-made structure under its jurisdiction. (Sec. 108) Requires adjustment of flood insurance risk premium rates to reflect the current risk of flood to property located in an area participating in the Program. Prohibits the Director, until flood insurance rate maps for all areas in the St. Louis District of the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps of Engineers are updated, from: (1) adjusting the chargeable flood insurance premium rate for any type or class of property located in an area in that District; or (2) requiring the purchase of flood insurance for any type or class of property located in such an area not subject to such purchase requirement before the updating of the national flood insurance program rate map. States that such an area does not include any area (or subdivision) that has chosen not to participate in the flood insurance program. (Sec. 109) Adds a new requirement for those states and areas where flood insurance must be made available. Requires such states or areas to give satisfactory assurance that by December 31, 2008, state-chartered lending institutions not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall be subject to state regulations consistent with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. (Sec. 110) Amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to increase from $350 to $2000 the civil monetary penalty for a single violation of the Act. Repeals the limitation upon the maximum penalty amount that may be imposed against any single regulated lending institution or enterprise in any calendar year. (Sec. 111) Revises the requirement that federal entities responsible for lending regulation require by regulation the payment of flood insurance premiums to a mortgage lender for deposit in an escrow account. Changes the property reference from real estate or mobile home to any property for which a loan has been made for purposes of acquisition or construction. Extends the same requirement to state entities responsible for lending regulations with respect to lending institutions they supervise. Requires any regulated lending institution, upon final payment of a mortgage, to notify the policyholder: (1) that insurance coverage may cease with such final payment; and (2) how flood insurance coverage may be continued after the life of the loan. (Sec. 112) Declares that the Secretary of the Treasury relinquishes the right to any repayment of loans to FEMA, subject to specified conditions, to the extent such borrowed sums were used to fund the payment of flood insurance claims resulting from the hurricanes of 2005. Increases from $1.5 billion to $20.775 billion, during FY2008 only, the maximum amount of loans and obligations the FEMA Director may issue to the Secretary of the Treasury with the President's approval for the Program. (Sec. 113) Prescribes minimum deductibles for claims under the Program for specified properties. Specifies the minimum annual deductible for pre-FIRM properties (containing a structure neither constructed nor substantially improved after the later of December 31, 1974, or the effective date of the initial rate map published by the FEMA Director under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 for the pertinent area) as: (1) $1,500, if the flood insurance covers structural damage of $100,000 or less; and (2) $2,000, if the flood insurance covers structural damage greater than $100,000. Sets the minimum annual deductible for post-FIRM properties at $750 in the first instance, and $1,000 in the second. (Sec. 114) Revises requirements for the FEMA Director's prescription of chargeable flood insurance premium rates. Repeals the requirement that the Director consult with certain entities before prescribing rates. Requires such rates, in addition to meeting other conditions, to be adequate, on the basis of accepted actuarial principles, to cover the average historical loss year obligations incurred by the National Flood Insurance Fund. (Sec. 115) Instructs the Director to establish in the Treasury a National Flood Insurance Reserve Fund, which shall maintain 1% of the sum of the total potential loss exposure of all outstanding flood insurance policies in force in the prior fiscal year, or any higher percentage the Director determines appropriate. (Sec. 116) Requires any funds borrowed by FEMA for the Program to include a repayment schedule, which shall be transmitted not only to the Secretary but to specified congressional committees. (Sec. 117) Prohibits FEMA from denying payment of certain flood insurance claims by condominium owners who purchased such flood insurance separate and apart from the flood insurance purchased by the condominium association, based on the flood insurance coverage of the association or others on the association's overall property. (Sec. 118) Establishes the Technical Mapping Advisory Council to make recommendations to the FEMA Director regarding: (1) flood insurance rate maps; (2) mapping standards; (3) interagency and intergovernmental coordination on flood mapping and flood risk determination; and (4) a future conditions risk assessment and modeling report. (Sec. 119) (Sec. 119) Requires the FEMA Director, in coordination with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, to establish an ongoing program for review, update, and maintenance of Program rate maps. Requires the Director to work to enhance communication and outreach to states, local communities, property owners, and community residents about the effects: (1) of any potential changes to National Flood Insurance Program rate maps that may result from such mapping program; and (2) that any such changes may have on flood insurance purchase requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2013. (Sec. 120) Removes the limitation placed upon state or local government contributions for the cost of updating flood maps. (Sec. 121) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, the FEMA Director, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the heads of specified federal agencies to: (1) coordinate and share data on flood risk determination and geospatial data; and (2) report to Congress an interagency budget crosscut report that displays the budget proposed for agencies working on flood risk determination data and digital elevation models, including planned agency transfers. (Sec. 122) Directs the National Academy of Public Administration to study and report to Congress on how FEMA can: (1) improve interagency coordination on flood mapping, including a funding strategy to leverage and coordinate budgets and expenditures; and (2) establish joint funding mechanisms with other governmental agencies. (Sec. 123) Exempts from certain floor insurance purchase requirements any area located within the 500-year flood plain. (Sec. 124) Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) to require that certain public information booklets include the availability of federal flood insurance. (Sec. 125) States that a temporary residential structure built for the purpose of testing certain new flood proofing technology in any state or community receiving flood mitigation assistance may not be construed to violate any flood risk mitigation plan developed by that state or community and approved by FEMA. (Sec. 126) Requires the FEMA Director, upon state insurance commissioner request, to cause Program representatives to participate in state disaster claims mediation programs. (Sec. 127) Directs FEMA to: (1) continue to work to implement minimum training and education standards for insurance agents who sell flood insurance policies; and (2) report to Congress on implementation of the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004. (Sec. 128) Directs the FEMA Director to collect, from property and casualty insurance companies authorized to participate in the Write Your Own program (WYO), any information needed to determine the accuracy of the resolution of flood claims filed on any property covered by a standard flood insurance policy obtained under WYO that was subject to a flood. (Sec. 129) Authorizes such companies to make specified biennial expense reports to Congress. Specifies a civil penalty for any property and casualty insurance company authorized to participate in the WYO program which fails to comply with specified reporting requirements or the requirement for biennial auditing of the flood insurance financial statements. Requires the FEMA Director to conduct rulemaking proceedings to: (1) devise a data collection methodology to allow FEMA to collect information on the expenses of property and casualty insurance companies participating in the WYO program for selling, writing, and servicing, standard flood insurance policies; and (2) formulate revised reimbursements to property and casualty insurance companies participating in the WYO program for their related expenses. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to specified congressional committees on the efficacy, adequacy, and sufficiency of such rules. (Sec. 130) Extends the pilot program for mitigation of severe repetitive loss properties through FY2013. Repeals the termination date for such program.
