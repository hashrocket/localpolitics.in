	7/26/2008--Reported to Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Revises the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) program of educational assistance for veterans who have served in the Armed Forces since September 11, 2001, to provide the maximum rates to be paid to individuals pursuing programs of education outside the United States at branches of educational institutions: (1) based in the United States; and (2) not based in the United States. Allows only public and private nonprofit institutions of higher education to participate in a VA program of public-private contributions for additional educational assistance for such veterans. Requires participating colleges and universities to: (1) report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on the manner in which the college or university would provide such additional assistance, and the amount provided to each participant; and (2) provide the same amount of additional assistance to all veterans receiving assistance at such college or university. Requires the VA to ensure that the Post-9/11 educational assistance program can be implemented by August 1, 2009. Provides authority for interim regulations.<br/>
