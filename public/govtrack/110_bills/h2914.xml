	6/28/2007--Introduced.<br/>Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2007 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to collect and review data on the differences, if any, between: (1) payments to physicians for immune globulins using average sales price payment methodology; and (2) costs incurred by physicians for furnishing these products. Requires the Secretary, after completion of the review, to provide, if appropriate, an additional payment to such physicians for all items related to the furnishing of immune globulins as part of hospital outpatient services. Provides for Medicare coverage of and payment for intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) administered in the home. Directs the Secretary to conduct two surveys, for reports to Congress, of Medicare and non-Medicare patients who need immune globulins in order to measure changes in patient access to those products (and providers furnishing them), as well as changes in the health care status of those patients.<br/>
