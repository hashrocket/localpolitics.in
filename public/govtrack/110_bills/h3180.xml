	7/25/2007--Introduced.<br/>Whistleblower Recovery Act of 2007 - Amends the False Claims Act regarding a federal civil action (&quot;whistle blower&quot; or qui tam action) brought by private persons. Revises the definition of &quot;original source&quot; relating to the requirement that, for any court to have jurisdiction over such an action based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accountability Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, the person bringing the action (if not the Attorney General) be an original source of the information. Redefines &quot;original source&quot; as an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of information that the individual has voluntarily provided to the government before filing an action that is the basis for either: (1) the allegations or transactions; or (2) public disclosure of the allegations or transactions. (Thus allows an individual who publicly discloses allegations or transactions of false claims to recover a portion of any awards following legal proceedings under the False Claims Act for those public disclosures, even though the individual does not know the precise way in which the wrongdoing occurs.)<br/>
