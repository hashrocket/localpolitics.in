	6/11/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Observes the 40th Anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Loving v. Virginia. Commemorates that case's legacy in: (1) ending the ban on interracial marriage in the United States; and (2) recognizing that marriage is one of the &quot;basic civil rights of man&quot; at the heart of the 14th Amendment protections.<br/>
