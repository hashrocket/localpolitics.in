	9/23/2008--Introduced.<br/>Universal Roaming Act of 2008 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a telecommunications carrier (and the carrier's affiliate) that receives federal universal service support in order to provide services for rural, insular, and high cost areas to offer automatic roaming services without territorial limitation or restriction on just and reasonable terms to a carrier that requests such services and provides technically compatible equipment. Allows a carrier to opt out of that requirement by notifying the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the carrier will cease to obtain universal service support for the provision of services for such areas. Prohibits construing this Act as prescribing particular rates for the provision of automatic roaming services. Gives &quot;automatic roaming&quot; the meaning given it in FCC regulations.<br/>
