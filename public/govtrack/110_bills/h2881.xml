(Sec. 308) Directs the FAA Administrator to: (1) conclude arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences for a study of pilot fatigue; and (2) initiate a process for the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) to carry out its recommendations for further study of flight attendant fatigue and to submit a report on such process to Congress no later than March 31, 2009.
