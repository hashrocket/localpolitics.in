	8/3/2007--Introduced.<br/>Renewing Our Commitment to Safe and Clean Power Act - Requires fees collected and deposited by the Secretary of Energy into the Nuclear Waste Fund to be credited to such Fund as discretionary offsetting collections each year in amounts not to exceed the amounts appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund for that year.<br/>Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 governing uses of such Fund to authorize costs incurred by the Secretary in connection with infrastructure activities to support construction or operation of a repository at the Yucca Mountain site or transportation to such site of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Instructs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), when it decides whether to permit construction or operation of a nuclear reactor, to deem without further consideration that sufficient capacity will be available in a timely manner to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste resulting from the operation of the reactor and related facilities.<br/>
