	12/21/2007--Public Law. Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act - Amends the National Organ Transplant Act to provide that for the purpose of provisions that prohibit the transfer of any human organ for use in human transplantation for valuable consideration, human organ paired donation does not involve such a transfer. Defines &quot;human organ paired donation&quot; as the donation and receipt of a human organ under the following circumstances: (1) an individual (the first donor) desires to make a living donation of a human organ specifically to a particular patient (the first patient), but such donor is biologically incompatible with such patient; (2) a second individual (the second donor) desires to make a such a donation to a second patient, but is biologically incompatible with such patient; (3) the first donor is biologically compatible to the second patient, and the second donor is biologically compatible to the first patient; (4) all donors and patients enter into a single agreement to donate and receive such organs; and (5) no valuable consideration is knowingly acquired, received, or otherwise transferred with respect to the organs.<br/>Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the progress made toward understanding the long-term health effects of living organ donation.<br/>
