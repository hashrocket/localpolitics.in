	5/3/2007--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Soviet Union's decades-long occupation of Estonia was illegal and a violation of Estonia's sovereignty. Expresses support for Estonia as a sovereign state and a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Condemns: (1) recent acts of violence and looting in Estonia; (2) attacks and threats against Estonia's embassies and officials in Russia and other countries; and (3) political efforts to exploit the memory of the victims of the Second World War. Urges all activists to express their views peacefully. Honors the sacrifice of all those, including Red Army soldiers, who gave their lives to defeat Nazism. Supports the government of Estonia's efforts to initiate a peaceful dialogue with the government of the Russian Federation. Urges the governments of all countries to: (1) condemn the violence that has occurred in Estonia, Moscow, and elsewhere in 2007, and to urge all parties to express their views peacefully; (2) assist the government of Estonia in its cyber-attacks investigation; and (3) fulfill their obligations under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.<br/>
