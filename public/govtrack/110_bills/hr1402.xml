	<summary>
	9/23/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Expresses support for: (1) the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh; and (2) the decision by the caretaker government of Bangladesh to hold free elections in December 2008. Urges all political parties to participate in the elections. Calls on the government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and remove other political restrictions, ensure human rights, freedom of speech, assembly, and association, and protect the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, particularly Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Ahmadis, and non-Muslim tribal peoples. Urges the President to: (1) work toward the return of democracy to Bangladesh as a high priority of U.S. foreign policy; and (2) consider, upon completion of an internationally-accepted free and fair election, extending generous economic support to Bangladesh.
