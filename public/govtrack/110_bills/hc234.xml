	10/29/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Encourages the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to: (1) halt the forced repatriation of North Koreans who face a well-founded fear of persecution if they are returned to North Korea; and (2) grant the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees access to determine such refugees' status and the degree of assistance to which they are entitled. Recognizes the efforts of the Korean-American community for bringing attention to the plight of North Korean refugees.
