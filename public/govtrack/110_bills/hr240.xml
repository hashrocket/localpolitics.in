	<summary>
	4/25/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Commends those countries that have: (1) ratified the amendments to the Bonn Accords for open access to the Holocaust archives of the International International Tracing Service (ITS) located at Bad Arolsen, Germany; and (2) committed to expedite such archives' release. Urges all: (1) countries that have not ratified the amendments to abide by their May 2006 treaty obligations and expedite such ratification; and (2) International Commission of the International Tracing Service members to consider the short time left to Holocaust survivors and unanimously consent to open the ITS archives should all countries not ratify the amendments by May 2007. Expresses the hope that bureaucratic and diplomatic processes will not further delay this process. Refuses to forget the murder of 6 million Jews and more than 5 million other victims during the Holocaust.<br/>
