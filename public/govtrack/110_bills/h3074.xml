	9/12/2007--Passed Senate amended. Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008 - Title I: Department of Transportation - Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2008 - Makes appropriations for FY2008 to the Department of Transportation, including: (1) the Office of the Secretary; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); (3) the Federal Highway Administration; (4) the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; (5) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA); (6) the Federal Railroad Administration; (7) the Federal Transit Administration (FTA); (8) the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation; (9) the Maritime Administration; (10) the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration; (11) the Research and Innovative Technology Administration; (12) the Office of Inspector General; and (13) the Surface Transportation Board.

(Sec. 112) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to reimburse amounts made available to credit a certain account to carry out the essential air service program from fees credited to the FAA. Makes inapplicable to FY2008 certain requirements for the use of fee proceeds for funding for small community air service, especially rural air safety improvement and rural airport projects.

(Sec. 115) Allows a pilot who has attained 60 years of age to serve as a passenger airline pilot until the age of 65 years old, provided that a pilot who has attained age 60 may serve as pilot-in-command on international flights if there is another pilot in the flight crew who has not yet attained 60 years of age. Prohibits subjecting pilots to different medical examinations and standards on account of age unless to ensure an adequate level of safety in flight, except that no person who has attained 60 years of age may serve as a pilot unless such person has a first-class medical certificate. Requires air carriers to: (1) continue to provide FAA-approved training to pilots, with specific emphasis on initial and recurring training and qualification of pilots who have attained 60 years of age; and (2) evaluate, every six months, the performance of pilots who have attained 60 years of age through a line check of such pilot. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the effect of the modification of pilot age requirements, if any, on aviation safety. (Sec. 116) Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) conduct a study on the efficacy of strategies employed by the FAA Administrator and the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to address flight delays at U.S. airports; and (2) to report the results of the study to Congress, with recommendations on strategies that most effectively reduce such delays when employed for six months or less. (Sec. 120) Prohibits for FY2008 distribution from the obligation limitation for federal-aid highways amounts authorized for specified administrative expenses and programs.

(Sec. 126) Permits certain funds amounts made available for a project for construction of and improvements to North Shore Road in Swain County, North Carolina, that remain unobligated and unexpended after issuance of the record of decision for that project, to be used to implement the selected alternative included in the record of decision. (Sec. 130) Subjects funds appropriated or limited in this Act to certain safety examination and other requirements of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 and the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 relating to Mexico-domiciled motor carriers involved in cross-border trucking between the United States and Mexico, including an annual report on the subject by the Secretary to the congressional appropriations committees. (Sec. 140) Makes certain additional funds available to NHTSA to pay for: (1) travel and related expenses for state management reviews; and (2) core competency development training and related expenses for highway safety staff.

(Sec. 152) Authorizes the Secretary to purchase promotional items of nominal value for use in public outreach activities to carry out solutions to the railroad grade crossing problem and measures to protect pedestrians in densely populated areas along railroad rights-of-way (Operation Lifesaver). Requires the Secretary to prescribe guidelines for the administration of such purchases and use. (Sec. 153) Declares that any lease or contract entered into between the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and the state of Maryland or any of its departments or agencies shall be governed by the laws of the District of Columbia.

Repeals the prohibition against the availability of certain related funds for any segment of the downtown Los Angeles to San Francisco Valley Metro Transit Rail project until the Southern California Rapid Transit District commits to UMTA that no part of the Metro Rail project will tunnel into or through any designated potential or high potential risk zone (for a methane gas explosion and fire in the Fairfax area).
