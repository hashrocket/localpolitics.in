	7/22/2008--Introduced.<br/>New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that 10% of new vehicles sold in the United States should be natural gas vehicles by December 31, 2018. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase the rate of the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property tax credit with respect to natural gas fuel; (2) allow new tax credits for investment in energy security bonds and natural gas vehicle production bonds; (3) allow a new tax credit for producing vehicles fueled by natural gas or liquified natural gas; (4) allow an increased alternative motor vehicle tax credit for the purchase of vehicles fueled by natural gas or liquified natural gas; and (5) extend through 2017 the tax credits for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property expenditures and for new qualified alternative fuel vehicles.<br/>Requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to study whether the federal fleet should increase the number of its natural gas vehicles. Requires each retail automotive fueling station owned by a major integrated oil company to have at least one pump dispensing natural gas for automotive purposes by January 1, 2018. Imposes a civil fine on oil companies that fail to comply with such requirement.<br/>
