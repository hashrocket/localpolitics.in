	7/10/2008--Introduced.<br/>Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act of 2008 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to include aquatic habitat restoration activities among activities the Great Lakes National Program Office is authorized to implement for the remediation of sediment contamination in areas of concern.<br/>Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from implementing such a remediation project if any nonfederal sponsor has not entered into a written agreement with the Administrator under which each party agrees to carry out its responsibilities and requirements for the project.<br/>Revises provisions concerning the nonfederal share of the project costs.<br/>Requires the Administrator to implement at federal expense the initial site characterization of a project for the remediation of contaminated sediment. Repeals a prohibition against implementing a project unless the nonfederal sponsor agrees to maintain aggregate expenditures from all other sources for remediation programs in the area of concern in which the project is located at or above the average level of such expenditures in the two fiscal years preceding the date on which the project is initiated.<br/>Authorizes appropriations through FY2013 for: (1) such remediation projects; and (2) the development and use of innovative approaches, technologies, and techniques for such remediation. Limits to 20% the amount of funds appropriated for remediation projects that may be used for site characterization.
