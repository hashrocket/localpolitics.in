	<summary>
	7/30/2007--Passed Senate amended. Recognizes the close relationship between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Sudan and urges the government the PRC to use its full influence to: (1) urge President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan to abide by his agreement to allow a U.N. peacekeeping force as described in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1706; (2) call for Sudanese compliance with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564 and the Darfur Peace Agreement which demand that Sudan disarm militias operating in Darfur; (3) call on all parties to the conflict to adhere to the 2004 N'Djamena ceasefire agreement and the recently-agreed U.N. communique; (4) emphasize that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur and that implementation of a legitimate peace agreement will contribute toward the welfare of the entire nation and broader region; (5) urge rebel groups to unify and assist all parties to come to the negotiating table; (6) urge the government of southern Sudan to play a more active role in pressing for peace talks; (7) continue to engage in high-level diplomacy and multilateral efforts toward a renewed peace process; and (8) join the international community in imposing economic and other consequences on the government of Sudan if it continues to carry out or support attacks on innocent civilians and frustrate diplomatic efforts. Recognizes that the spirit of the Olympics, which is to bring together nations and people from all over the world in peace, is incompatible with actions supporting acts of genocide.
