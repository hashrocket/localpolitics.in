	2/28/2007--Introduced.<br/>Universal Service for the 21st Century Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require all telecommunications carriers (currently, only those providing interstate telecommunications services) to contribute to the universal service fund (a fund whose goal is to provide advanced telecommunications services to all areas of the country). Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a permanent mechanism to support universal service that will preserve and enhance its long-term financial stability. Gives the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to establish rates for inter-carrier compensation payments, including compensation for the origination and termination of intrastate telecommunications traffic. Establishes within the universal service fund the Broadband for Unserved Areas Account, to provide financial assistance for the deployment of broadband (high-speed) communications services to unserved areas throughout the United States. Allows assistance to be provided only to: (1) facilities-based providers of broadband communications service; and (2) one facility-based provider in any unserved area.<br/>
