The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)<br/>Ratifies and approves the Jicarilla Apache Nation's quitclaim deed for the Settlement Lands to Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, but such ratification and approval shall be effective only upon satisfaction of the following conditions: (1) that the Board of Commissioners of the Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, has enacted a resolution permanently abandoning a specified disputed county road and has submitted a copy of that resolution to the Secretary of the Interior; and (2) that the Jicarilla Apache Nation has executed a quitclaim deed to Rio Arriba County for specified settlement lands subject to the exceptions identified in the Settlement Agreement and has submitted a copy of such deed to the Secretary. Makes such ratification and approval effective only as of the date that the Secretary publishes findings in the Federal Register that the conditions have been met.<br/>Requires the Secretary, following publication of the findings, to issue to the County a patent for the Settlement lands. Subjects the patent to all valid existing rights of third parties, including but not limited to easements of record. Requires that the patent include a specified perpetual restrictive covenant running with the Settlement Lands for the benefit of the lands comprising the Jicarilla Apache Reservation adjacent to the Settlement Lands. Provides that the lands conveyed to the County in such patent shall cease to be a part of the Jicarilla Apache Reservation and the exterior boundary of the Reservation shall be deemed relocated accordingly.<br/>
