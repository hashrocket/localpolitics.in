	5/24/2007--Introduced.<br/>President Gerald R. Ford Iraqi Ally and Refugee Responsibility Memorial Act of 2007 - States that the United States: (1) accepts responsibility for the welfare and safety of Iraqis and their immediate family members who, as a consequence of working for or assisting the U.S. government or the U.S. Armed Forces, have become internally displaced or refugees or have a well-grounded fear of persecution or physical harm; and (2) will assist all Iraq refugees, including internally displaced Iraqis, and acknowledges that U.S. actions contributed to the refugee problem that developed subsequent to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees respecting: (1) the number of Iraqis who have been employed in Iraq by the U.S. government, the U.S. Armed Forces, coalition forces, contractors, and international organizations; and (2) plans to accelerate U.S. assistance to Iraqi refugees. Directs the President to submit to Congress legislative proposals to facilitate the resettlement in the United States of Iraqis who have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their employment by or assistance to the United States or a coalition country in Iraq.<br/>
