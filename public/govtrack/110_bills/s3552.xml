	9/24/2008--Introduced.<br/>National Fish Habitat Conservation Act - Establishes a National Fish Habitat Board to promote, oversee, and coordinate the implementation of this Act and the existing National Fish Habitat Action Plan and to review and recommend fish habitat conservation projects. Authorizes the Board to designate Fish Habitat Conservation Partnerships to coordinate Plan implementation at a regional level and develop and carry out fish habitat conservation projects. Sets forth Partnership approval criteria, including that a Partnership: (1) have representatives of a diverse group of public and private partners that are focused on conservation of aquatic habitats to achieve results across jurisdictional boundaries and public and private lands; and (2) is able to address issues and priorities at a nationally significant scale. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to fund, from amounts appropriated under this Act, up to 50% of the cost of approved fish habitat conservation projects. Requires the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to: (1) create the National Fish Habitat Conservation Partnership Office within such Service; and (2) develop the Office's interagency operational plan and its technical and scientific assistance program. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into a cooperative agreement or contract with a Partnership for fish habitat conservation, restoration, and enhancement projects; and (2) enter into an agreement with a charitable organization to solicit private donations to carry out the this Act.<br/>
