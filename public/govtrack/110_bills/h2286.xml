	6/25/2007--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Bail Bond Fairness Act of 2007 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit a judicial officer from declaring forfeited a bail bond for violation of specified collateral release conditions other than failing to appear in court. Makes forfeiture of a bail bond for violation of such collateral release conditions unavailable as a sanction.<br/>Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to provide that if a defendant fails to appear physically before the court (currently, if there is a breach of a condition of a bond), the court shall declare a forfeiture of the bail.<br/>
