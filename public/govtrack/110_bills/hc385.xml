	7/15/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Reiterates condemnation of the 1994 attack on the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, honors the victims of the attack, and expresses sympathy to the victims' relatives. Applauds the government of Argentina for increasing the pace of the AMIA bombing investigation. Commends the General Assembly of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) for upholding and issuing the Red Notices. Expresses concern regarding the government of Saudi Arabia's failure to detain certain Iranian officials in connection with the AMIA case. Urges: (1) all nations to cooperate fully with the AMIA investigation; and (2) governments in the Western Hemisphere to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and to penalize those providing support for Hezbollah and other Islamist terrorist organizations. Encourages the President to direct U.S. law enforcement agencies, upon Argentine request, to cooperate in the AMIA investigation.<br/>
