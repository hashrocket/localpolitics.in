	4/10/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Declares that the House committee and floor consideration requirements of the Trade Act of 1974 for automatic discharge from committee of an implementing bill after a specified period of time, a vote on final passage after 15 days from report or discharge, and the highly privileged and non-debatable character of a motion to proceed to consideration of the bill shall not apply in the case of H.R. 5724, a bill to implement the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.<br/>
