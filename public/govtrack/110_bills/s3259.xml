	7/14/2008--Introduced.<br/>Consumer Credit Fairness Act - Amends federal bankruptcy law governing equitable subordination of claims in a bankruptcy case to: (1) subordinate a claim arising from a high cost consumer credit transaction to all other claims; and (2) require transfer to the estate in bankruptcy of any lien securing a subordinated claim. Defines &quot;high cost consumer credit transaction&quot; as an extension of credit by a creditor resulting in a consumer debt with an applicable annual percentage rate (APR), including related costs and fees, that exceeds the lesser of: (1) the sum of 15% and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities having a 30-year period of maturity; or (2) 36%. Excludes a debtor's petition for relief resulting from a high cost consumer credit transaction from mandatory consideration for dismissal, or conversion to a case under chapter 11 or 13, based upon a finding of substantial abuse.<br/>
