	4/17/2008--Introduced.<br/>Great Ape Protection Act - Prohibits: (1) persons from conducting invasive research on great apes; (2) federal funds from being used to conduct such research; (3) persons from knowingly importing, exporting, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, renting, loaning, purchasing, or selling great apes for such research; and (4) persons from breeding great apes for use in such research.<br/>Declares that this Act does not limit or prevent individualized medical care performed on great apes by licensed veterinarians for the benefit of the great apes.<br/>Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide for the permanent retirement of all great apes that are owned or under the control of the federal government and that have been used for invasive research. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for the euthanizing of such apes if it is in their best interest as determined by an attending veterinarian and endorsed by a second, unaffiliated veterinarian.<br/>Defines &quot;invasive research&quot; to mean experimental research that may cause death, bodily injury, pain, distress, fear, injury, or trauma to great apes. Excludes: (1) close observation of natural or voluntary behavior, provided that it does not require the removal of apes from their social group or environment or require an anesthetic or sedation event to collect data or record observations; or (2) post-mortem examinations of great apes following their natural death.<br/>
