	<summary>
	4/9/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Recognizes that small business plumbing contractors have benefited from the reduced regulatory burden provided as a result of passage of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. Recognizes that the loan guarantee program under Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act administered by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration has provided access to capital for small business plumbing contractors. Recognizes that approximately 80% of plumbing contractors around the country are small, family owned and run companies. Recognizes these small firms account for a large percentage of our Nation's GDP, through sales, service, and repair. Recognizes how small businesses in the plumbing industry are the leader in developing, and utilizing new innovative technologies which help improve and maintain the infrastructure our Nation depends on. Supports the goals and ideals of National Plumbing Industry Week (April 27-May 3, 2008).<br/>
