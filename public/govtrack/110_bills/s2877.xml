Directs the Secretary to make grants to: (1) establish or improve training programs for health care professionals to improve follow-up care for young cancer survivors and to ensure that such care is linguistically and culturally competent; (2) pay costs incurred during the first four years of operating a clinic for comprehensive long-term followup services for childhood cancer survivors; and (3) improve physical and psychosocial care for such survivors.
