	9/10/2008--Introduced.<br/>Calls for the Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive strategy to increase and encourage investigation and prosecution of sexual assault and rape cases in the military. Sets forth elements to be included in such strategy, including: (1) requiring commanders to be held accountable for sexual assaults and rapes in their units and for disposition of such cases; (2) developing prevention and response programs to create a culture that prevents sexual assault and rape in the military and encourages more reporting by victims; (3) reviewing the capacity of the legal infrastructure in the Armed Forces to investigate and prosecute effectively sexual assault cases; (4) examining any barriers on military facilities to conducting effective investigations of sexual assault and rape cases; and (5) ensuring that the command affords an alleged sexual assault victim an opportunity for a transfer if a military protection order is issued.<br/>
