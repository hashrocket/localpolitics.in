Security Council to authorize a United Nations Special Representative for Zimbabwe; (5) urge African leaders to engage in the political resolution effort; (6) urge the United States and the international community to assemble a comprehensive economic and political recovery package; and (7) support a democratic political solution that reflects the will and respects the rights of the people of Zimbabwe.<br/>
