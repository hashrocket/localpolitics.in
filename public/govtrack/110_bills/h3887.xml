Directs the President to: (1) establish related performance goals and indicators; and (2) ensure that U.S. development and emergency programs are carried out consistent with policies and programs to combat trafficking. Requires the Director to provide U.S. assistance consistent with annual reporting priorities and country assessments. Obligates specified FY2008-FY2011 funds for activities under this section. (Sec. 106) Repeals the limitation that only countries with a significant number of trafficking victims be monitored.

(Sec. 107) Deems a country that has been on the special watch list for two consecutive years to be not making significant efforts to combat trafficking unless the Secretary of State determines that the country: (1) has a written plan that would constitute making such efforts; and (2) is devoting sufficient resources to the plan's implementation.
