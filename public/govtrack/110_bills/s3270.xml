Requires, with respect to the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) project: (1) an assessment of the effects of increased funding under this Act upon development of project capabilities; and (2) a competition for completion of the COTS crewed vehicle demonstration project by the end of FY2011, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.<br/>(Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator to: (1) submit a plan to Congress for disposition of the remaining Space Shuttle Orbiters and related hardware and facilities after retirement of the fleet; and (2) establish a Space Shuttle Transition Liaison Office to assist communities affected by termination of the Shuttle program.<br/>(Sec. 7) Requires an analysis of facilities and human capital resources that will become available as a result of the retirement of the Space Shuttle program and identify programs and projects that could use such facilities and resources.<br/>(Sec. 8) Requires a report on a plan to support the operations of the International Space Station (ISS) beyond FY2015 for a period of not less than five years.<br/>(Sec. 9) Requires the Administrator to report a plan for continuing the activities described in the operation plan of the ISS National Laboratory submitted to Congress in May 2007 and a budget plan that reflects the anticipated use of such activities and the amount projected to be required for FY2010-FY2020 to accomplish the objectives of such activities.<br/>Requires establishment of an International Space Station Utilization Advisory Committee and development of an implementation plan for a structure for management of national laboratory research. Establishes in the Treasury an International Space Station Research Fund.<br/>(Sec. 10) Requires the planning and carrying out of an additional Shuttle mission for the scientific utilization of the U.S. portion of the ISS as a National Laboratory by the delivery of launch-ready scientific payloads, such as the alpha magnetic spectrometer, as soon as the assembly of the ISS is completed.<br/>(Sec. 11) Expresses the sense of Congress concerning use of the Space Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center as an asset in ISS National Laboratory capability.<br/>(Sec. 12) Reaffirms congressional support for well-balanced scientific research support by NASA and for nanotechnology research and development and application. Expresses the sense of Congress concerning emphasis on fundamental and basic research and the transition to application development and concerning use by NASA's nanotechnology policy for ongoing research and development in green nanoscience and nanomanufacturing.<br/>(Sec. 13) Expresses the sense of Congress concerning aeronautics research and the impact of sonic booms.<br/>Requires the following research initiatives: (1) development of technologies to achieve the environmental goals delineated in the Energy and Environment component of the National Plan for Aeronautics Research and Development and Related Infrastructure submitted to the President in accordance with Executive Order 13419; (2) alignment of the fundamental aeronautics research program to address high-priority technology challenges described in the 2006 report of the National Research Council entitled &quot;Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics&quot;; (3) sonic boom impact research; (4) independent review of NASA aviation-safety related research; and (5) implementation of the Climate Change Research Initiative as described in the report of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program for FY2008 entitled &quot;Our Changing Planet.&quot;<br/>Requires research and development activities performed by the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate with the primary objective of assisting in the development of a flight project in another Mission Directorate of the Agency to be funded by the Mission Directorate seeking assistance.<br/>Requires the Administrator to award grants to institutions of higher education to establish one or more Centers for Research on Aviation Training under cooperative agreements with appropriate NASA Centers.<br/>(Sec. 14) Requires the Administrator to develop an enhanced-use lease policy that is based upon sound business practices and lessons learned from the demonstration centers and establishes controls and procedures to ensure accountability and protect the government's interests. Revises procedures for the retention of cash consideration received by NASA field centers. Requires studies on the leasing practices of all field centers and project assignment and work allocation at such centers.<br/>(Sec. 17) Requires establishment of an interagency commission to study the establishment of a space launch range and facilities dedicated to commercial space missions.<br/>(Sec. 18) Expresses the sense of Congress concerning appointment by the President of members to the National Space Council in accordance with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989.<br/>(Sec. 19) Requires the Administrator to review and report on NASA suborbital mission capabilities.<br/>(Sec. 20) Requires the Administrator to initiate discussions with appropriate representatives of other space-faring countries to determine an appropriate framework under which information intended to promote safe access into outer space, operations in outer space, and return from outer space to Earth free from physical or radio-frequency interference can be shared.<br/>(Sec. 21) Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to study the impact of current export control policies and implementation directives on national security, the U.S. aerospace industry, and the ability of federal agencies to carry out cooperative activities in science and technology and human space flight, including the impact on research carried out under the sponsorship of such agencies.<br/>(Sec. 22) Reaffirms the policy set forth in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 relating to surveying near-Earth asteroids and comets.
