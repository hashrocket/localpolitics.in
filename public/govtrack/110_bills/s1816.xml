National Women's Rights History Project Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the National Park Service (NPS), to designate a vehicular tour route, to be known as the Votes for Women History Trail Route, to link properties in the state of New York that are historically and thematically associated with the struggle for women's suffrage in the United States. Requires the National Park Service to administer the Trail through the Women's Rights National Historical Park (established under prior law).

Instructs the Secretary to ensure that National Register travel itinerary website entitled &quot;Places Where Women Made History,&quot; is updated to contain the results of the inventory of women's rights history properties conducted pursuant to this Act and any links to websites related to places on such inventory. Provides for the designation of a non-governmental managing network to manage the network developed under this Act and to work in partnership with the Director of the NPS and state historic preservation offices to coordinate operation of the network. Allows matching grants for historic preservation specific to the network to be available through state historic preservation offices. Authorizes appropriations.
