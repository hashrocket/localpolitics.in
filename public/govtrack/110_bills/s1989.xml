	8/3/2007--Introduced.<br/>Pigford Claims Remedy Act of 2007 - Declares that any Pigford claimant (relating to a racial discrimination action against the Department of Agriculture) who has not previously obtained a determination on the merits of a Pigford claim may, in a civil action, obtain that determination. Asserts that it is Congress's intent that this Act be liberally construed so as to effectuate its remedial purpose of giving a full determination on the merits for each denied Pigford claim. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide a claimant with a report on farm credit loans made within the claimant's county or adjacent county during a specified period which shall contain information on all accepted applicants (but without any personally identifiable information), including: (1) the applicant's race; (2) the application and loan decision dates; and (3) the location of the office making the loan decision. Sets forth provisions respecting: (1) expedited claim resolution; and (2) foreclosure limitation. Defines: (1) &quot;Pigford claimant&quot; as an individual who previously submitted a late-filing request under the consent decree in the case of Pigford v. Glickman (1999); and (2) &quot;Pigford claim&quot; as a discrimination complaint as defined and documented by such consent decree.<br/>
