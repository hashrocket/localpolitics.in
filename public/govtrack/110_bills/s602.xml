	11/17/2008--Public Law. Child Safe Viewing Act of 2007 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to initiate a notice of inquiry to consider measures to examine: (1) the existence and availability of advanced blocking technologies that are compatible with various communications devices or platforms; (2) methods of encouraging the development, deployment, and use of such technology by parents that do not affect the packaging or pricing of a content provider's offering; and (3) the availability and use of parental empowerment tools and initiatives already in the market. Requires that the FCC consider advanced blocking technologies that: (1) may be appropriate across a wide variety of distribution platforms (including wired, wireless, and Internet platforms) and transmitting or receiving devices; (2) can filter language based on information in closed captioning; (3) operate independently of the program creator's ratings; and (4) may enhance the parent's ability to protect his or her child from indecent or objectionable programming, as determined by that parent. Requires a report to Congress. Defines &quot;advanced blocking technologies&quot; as technologies that can improve or enhance the ability of a parent to protect his or her child from any indecent or objectionable video or audio programming, as determined by the parent, transmitted through wire, wireless, or radio communication.<br/>
