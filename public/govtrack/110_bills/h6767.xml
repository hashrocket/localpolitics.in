	7/31/2008--Introduced.<br/>Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act - Amends the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to limit the federal share of the cost of acquiring land for, or construction or expansion of, public target ranges in eligible states to 90% of such cost. Defines &quot;eligible state&quot; to mean a state that, since the most recent decennial census, has experienced: (1) at least a 2% growth in population; and (2) a reduction in the acreage of federal lands in such state where target practice and marksmanship training are permitted. Specifies that amounts made available and apportioned for grants that are provided to eligible states under the firearm and bow hunter education and safety program for acquiring land for, or construction or expansion of, public target ranges shall remain available until they are expended. Permits not more than 10% of the amounts apportioned to an eligible state under the Act for such state's wildlife conservation and restoration program to be used for acquiring land for, or construction or expansion of, public target ranges or for assisting a federal land-management agency with environmental remediation or other steps needed to allow for public target ranges on federal lands.
