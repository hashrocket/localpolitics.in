	7/7/2008--Introduced.<br/>Encourages the Air Force to quickly recompete the KC-X (aerial refueling aircraft) solicitation on terms the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended in its June 18, 2008, decision. Recognizes that a rapid, thorough, and fair recompetition is the best means to provide the Air Force with next-generation aerial refueling tanker capability in a timely manner. Recognizes that such solicitation is the first of a three-phased strategy for recapitalizing the tanker fleet, and that it should be based on a full and transparent competition to select a single aircraft design. Supports the GAO recommendation that the Air Force reopen discussions with the offerors, obtain and reevaluate revised proposals, and make a new source selection decision.<br/>
