	10/18/2007--Introduced.<br/>Calls on the Secretary of State to determine if the charges brought against United Nations Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Sigma Huda, constitute a retaliation by the military-backed government of Bangladesh for her family's alleged political activities. Asks the President to direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to submit a resolution to the United Nations condemning the caretaker government for its human rights violations. Proposes that the President recognize the return of democracy to Bangladesh as a high priority of U.S. foreign policy.
