	5/24/2007--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Calls on the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to release Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, replace her lost travel documents, and cease its harassment tactics. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the U.S. government, through all appropriate means and diplomatic channels, should encourage the government of Iran to release Dr. Esfandiari and offer her an apology; and (2) the United States should coordinate its response with its allies throughout the Middle East, other governments, and all appropriate international organizations.<br/>
