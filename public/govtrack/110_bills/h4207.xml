	11/15/2007--Introduced.<br/>Partnership for Children and Families Act - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to revise the eligibility requirements for adoption assistance and foster care maintenance payments, eliminating certain income criteria. Allows each state with an approved part E plan to apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) receive foster care maintenance payment savings achieved (in a &quot;child welfare reinvestment fund&quot;) by reducing the total number of days children in the state experience in foster care during the fiscal year; and (2) use the savings to provide children with family preservation services, family support services, time-limited family reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services, and to train the staff of state and local child welfare agencies in effective service practices.<br/>
