(Sec. 112) Requires the International Trade Commission (ITC) to notify the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce of affirmative determinations of: (1) serious injury or market disruption, or threat of serious injury or market disruption, to a domestic industry; and (2) injury, or threat of injury, to a domestic industry by reason of imports which have been provided a countervailing or antidumping subsidy.
