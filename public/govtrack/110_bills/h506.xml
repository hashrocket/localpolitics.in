	1/17/2007--Introduced.<br/>Health Partnership Through Creative Federalism Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a State Health Coverage Innovation Commission to: (1) request states to submit proposals for state health care expansion and improvement programs, which may include reform options such as tax credit approaches, expansions of public programs, or other appropriate alternatives; (2) review state applications and submit to Congress a list of state applications that the Commission recommends for approval; (3) report to the public concerning progress made by states; and (4) make recommendations to the Secretary and Congress for minimizing the negative effect of state programs on national employer groups, provider organizations, and insurers because of differing state requirements under the programs. Requires states to prepare and submit to the Commission a healthcare plan that has as its goal increased coverage and such additional goals as improvements in quality, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the appropriate use of information technology. Sets forth rules for congressional consideration of state proposals. Requires the Secretary to provide a grant to a state that has an application approved to enable such state to carry out an innovative state health program. Requires the Commission to direct the Secretary to: (1) fund a balanced diversity of approaches; and (2) link allocations to the state to the meeting of goals and performance measures related to health care coverage and health care costs. Prohibits states from: (1) changing eligibility criteria for state medical assistance programs; or (2) permitting the imposition of any preexisting condition exclusion for covered benefits, with exceptions.<br/>
