	8/1/2008--Passed Senate amended. DTV Border Fix Act of 2008 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow the renewal of a full-power analog television broadcasting license through February 17, 2013, for stations located within 50 miles of the U.S. border with Mexico, provided certain requirements are met, including that the renewal does not: (1) prevent the auction of recovered spectrum; (2) encumber or interfere with any channel reserved for public safety use; and (3) prevent the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from considering or granting a request for waiver submitted for public safety service prior to enactment of this Act. Requires the FCC, if mutually exclusive applications are submitted to use a channel under the amendments made by this Act, to award the authority to use the channel through competitive bidding under existing procedures. Prohibits the FCC from extending or renewing a full-power television broadcast license that authorizes analog service on or after February 17, 2013.<br/>
