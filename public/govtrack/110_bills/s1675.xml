	3/4/2008--Reported to Senate amended. Local Community Radio Act of 2007 - Repeals provisions in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, that required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations to prescribe minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels; (2) prohibit applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station from obtaining a low-power FM license; and (3) conduct a program to test whether low-power FM radio stations will result in harmful interference to existing FM radio stations if minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels are not required. Requires the FCC to: (1) modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between specified stations; and (2) retain rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power noncommercial FM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference. Requires the FCC, when licensing FM translator stations, to ensure: (1) that licenses are available to both FM translator stations and low-power FM stations; and (2) that such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community. Requires the FCC to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations, as proposed in a specified docket, to prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low-power FM license if the applicant has engaged in any manner in the unlicensed operation of any station; (2) retain its rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations that are licensed in states with more than 3,000,000 housing units and a population density greater than 1,000 people per square mile land area; and (3) conduct an economic study on the impact that low-power FM stations will have on full-power commercial FM stations.<br/>
