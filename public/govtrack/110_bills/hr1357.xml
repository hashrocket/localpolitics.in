	7/31/2008--Passed House amended. Reaffirms the nation's commitment to equal justice under the law for all people in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. Continues to support the congressional goal embodied in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 that all persons living under protection of the U.S. Constitution have a right to enjoy freedom and equality without the constraint of prejudice and discrimination or the lack of due process. Declares that the House of Representatives shall review the wartime treatment of Latin Americans of Japanese descent, German Americans, and Italian Americans to determine whether they should receive an apology and reparations similar to that provided for Japanese Americans interned during World War II.<br/>
