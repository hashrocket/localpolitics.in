	7/17/2008--Introduced.<br/>Resist Offsetting with Additional Debt Act or the ROAD Act - Rescinds unobligated balances of certain earmarked surface transportation projects under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) and certain other appropriations Acts (in order to eliminate the deficit in the Highway Trust Fund (HTF)). Prohibits: (1) recalculation of amounts allocated for surface transportation projects under the Equity bonus program for a fiscal year to take such rescissions into account; and (2) the transfer of funds from the General Fund of the Treasury in order to alleviate the deficit in the HTF (except amounts equivalent to certain taxes and penalties). Expresses the sense of Congress that state transportation departments should consider implementing certain projects under the highway bridge program and the surface transportation program that improve transportation safety.<br/>
