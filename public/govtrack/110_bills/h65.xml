The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Lumbee Recognition Act - Extends federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, as designated as petitioner number 65 by the Office of Federal Acknowledgment.<br/>Permits any group of Indians in Robeson and adjoining counties, North Carolina, whose members are not enrolled in the Tribe to petition for acknowledgment of tribal existence. Makes the Tribe and its members eligible for all services and benefits provided to Indians because of their status as members of a federally recognized tribe. Deems, for purposes of delivery of such services, those members of the Tribe residing in Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke, and Scotland Counties in North Carolina to be residing on or near an Indian reservation.<br/>Instructs the Secretary to treat fee lands which the Tribe seeks to convey to the United States to be held in trust as &quot;on-reservation&quot; trust acquisitions if such lands are located within Robeson County. Prohibits the Tribe from conducting gaming activities.<br/>Grants the state of North Carolina jurisdiction over all criminal offenses and all civil actions on lands within North Carolina that are owned by or held in trust for the Tribe or any independent Indian community of the Tribe. Authorizes the Secretary to accept any transfer by the state of any portion of the state's jurisdiction of such offenses and actions pursuant to an agreement between the Tribe and the state. Bars such transfer of jurisdiction from taking effect until two years after the effective date of the agreement. Authorizes appropriations.
