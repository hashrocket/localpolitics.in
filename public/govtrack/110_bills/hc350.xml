	6/18/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Declares that the United States, through the International Whaling Commission, should: (1) use all appropriate measures to end commercial whaling, including scientific, special permit, coastal, and community-based whaling; (2) oppose any initiative that would result in any new, Commission-sanctioned coastal or community-based whaling, even if it is portrayed as noncommercial, including commercial whaling by coastal communities that does not qualify as aboriginal subsistence whaling; and (3) seek to strengthen conservation and management measures.<br/>
