	7/31/2007--Introduced.<br/>BRAC Cost Overruns Protection Act of 2007 or BRAC COP Act of 2007 - Amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary of Defense to report to the congressional defense committees on the costs of implementing recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission that relate to military base closures and realignments that have not been fully implemented. Requires the Secretary to: (1) notify such committees if the Secretary determines that the current estimate of implementation costs for an individual major base closure or realignment is at least 25% greater than the baseline estimate for such closure or realignment; and (2) develop a business plan to reduce the costs of any individual substantially over-budget major base closure or realignment to a level less than 25% greater than its baseline estimate. Directs the: (1) Secretary to submit to the President a recommendation regarding whether to continue implementation of a substantially over-budget major base closure or realignment; and (2) President to report to Congress regarding the implementation of such a closure or realignment. Prohibits the Secretary from continuing or discontinuing the implementation of a substantially over-budget major closure or realignment recommended by the President if a joint resolution disapproving the President's recommendation is enacted.<br/>
