(Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop individualized plans for the rehabilitation and reintegration of veterans with TBI, and to provide each plan to the individual before their discharge from inpatient care, following transition from active duty to the VA for outpatient care, or as soon as practicable following diagnosis. Requires each plan to be based upon a comprehensive assessment of: (1) the physical, cognitive, vocational, neuropsychological, and social impairments of the individual; and (2) the family education and support needs of the individual after discharge from inpatient care. Requires the Secretary to designate a case manager for each such veteran. Requires: (1) the involvement of family members in plan development; and (2) the Secretary to periodically evaluate plan effectiveness.
