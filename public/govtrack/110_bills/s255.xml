	2/15/2007--Reported to Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) New Mexico Water Planning Assistance Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, at the request of the governor of New Mexico and acting through the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Geological Survey, to: (1) provide to New Mexico technical assistance and grants for the development of comprehensive state water plans; (2) conduct water resources mapping in New Mexico; and (3) conduct a comprehensive study of groundwater resources in New Mexico to assess the quantity, quality, and interaction of groundwater and surface water resources. Lists types of technical assistance that may be provided, including acquisition of hydrologic data, expansion of groundwater monitoring networks, and coordination of federal water management planning efforts.

Sets the non-federal share of the total cost of any activity carried out using a grant under this Act at 50%, which may be in the form of in-kind services. Requires: (1) any assistance or grants provided to New Mexico under this Act to be made on a non-reimbursable basis; and (2) the Secretary, at that state's request, to directly transfer to one or more federal agencies any amounts made available to New Mexico to carry out this Act.
