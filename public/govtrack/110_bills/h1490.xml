	<summary>
	3/13/2007--Introduced.<br/>Presumes a claimant presenting a claim for veterans' benefits with respect to a service-connected disability or death to have presented a valid claim of service-connectedness, unless the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines there is positive evidence to the contrary. Requires the claimant to support the claim with proof of service in a conflict referred to in the claim, as well as a brief description of the nature, including service-connection, of the disability or claim. Directs the Secretary to redeploy, for the purpose of assisting veterans applying for benefits, those employees involved with processing claims that are no longer needed to evaluate claims due to the above presumption.<br/>
