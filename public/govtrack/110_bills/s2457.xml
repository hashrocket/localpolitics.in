	5/8/2008--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on February 5, 2008. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Provides that the United States shall not be liable for any loss resulting from such a renewal. Prohibits any entity from conducting gaming activity on any land that is leased with an option to renew under this Act.<br/>
