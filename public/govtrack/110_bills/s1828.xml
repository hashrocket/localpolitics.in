	7/19/2007--Introduced.<br/>Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the feasibility of increasing consumption in the United States of ethanol-blended gasoline with levels of ethanol of not less than 10% and not more than 40%.<br/>Requires the study to evaluate: (1) production and infrastructure constraints on increasing consumption; (2) the economic, market, and energy impacts of state and regional differences in ethanol blends and of separate and distinctly-labeled fuel storage facilities and dispensers; (3) the environmental impacts of mid-level ethanol blends on evaporative and exhaust emissions from, and on the operation, durability and performance of, on-road, off-road, and marine engines, recreational boats, vehicles, and equipment (engines); and (4) the safety impacts of mid-level ethanol blends on consumers that own and operate such engines.<br/>Amends the Clean Air Act to authorize the Administrator to approve an application to waive specified prohibitions concerning new fuels and fuel additives only after providing for notice and an opportunity for public comment (repeals a provision treating an application as granted if the Adminsitrator fails to act on it within 180 days).<br/>
