	<summary>
	7/17/2008--Introduced.<br/>Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) restore the unified credit against the estate and gift tax after 2009; (2) establish the amount of such credit at $3.5 million adjusted for inflation in calendar years after 2010; and (3) reduce the maximum estate and gift tax rate to 45%. Expresses the sense of the Senate that any reduction in federal revenues resulting from this Act should be fully offset.
