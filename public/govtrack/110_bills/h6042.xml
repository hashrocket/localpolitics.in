Requires the Board and the Committee to: (1) establish a definition of the goal of price stability; (2) implement such definition through inflation targets; and (3) specify a timeframe for achieving such goal. Directs the Board to determine in advance what action it will take if the goal of fully achieving price stability is not met within the timeframe established by the Board and the Committee.<br/>
