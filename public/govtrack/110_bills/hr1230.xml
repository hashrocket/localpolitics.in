	6/19/2008--Passed House amended. Condemns the campaign of violence and harassment in Zimbabwe conducted by the ruling party and its supporters in the police and military against members of the opposition and other civilians. Calls on the government of Zimbabwe to create an environment conducive to a peaceful transition of power. Encourages the political parties to commit to forming a government that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people and promotes national unity. Urges the international community, under the leadership of the United Nations, the African Union (AU), and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), to deploy monitors to ensure that the presidential runoff election reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people. Commends: (1) the people of Zimbabwe for their continued courage in the face of intimidation and commits to providing continued humanitarian assistance until the economic crisis is resolved; and (2) activists, civil society organizations, and churches for supporting the rule of law in Zimbabwe. Stands in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe.<br/>
