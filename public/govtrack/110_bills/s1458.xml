Requires a project to be in a county: (1) that is in nonattainment under the Clean Air Act with respect to ambient air quality standards for ozone, particulate matter, or both; (2) in which there is air quality degradation to which agricultural emissions significantly contribute; or (3) in which pesticide drift is a priority concern.
