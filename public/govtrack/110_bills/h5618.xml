	10/15/2008--Public Law. National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2008 - (Sec. 4) Amends the National Sea Grant College Program Act to substitute &quot;extension services&quot; for &quot;advisory services&quot; in the definition of &quot;project.&quot; (Sec. 5) Adds regional and national projects as elements of the national sea grant college program. Removes a reference to the sea grant review panel from provisions relating to the administration of the program. Refers to regional or national strategic investments being developed in consultation with the board and with the approval of sea grant colleges and the sea grant institutes. (Current law refers to the approval of the sea grant review panel as well as the colleges and institutes.) Revises the program director's duties. (Sec. 6) Excludes amounts appropriated under provisions relating to graduate ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources fellowships (the Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship Program) from provisions restricting contributions by the Secretary of Commerce to two-thirds of the total cost of sea grant programs and projects. (Sec. 7) Requires that sea grant colleges provide extension services (currently, advisory services). (Sec. 8) Requires that amounts available for fellowships (under provisions relating to graduate and post-graduate fellowships related to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources), including funds from other federal departments and agencies and appropriated funds, be used only for those fellowships and related administrative costs. (Sec. 9) Redesignates the sea grant review panel as the National Sea Grant Advisory Board and modifies it's duties. (Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations through FY2014. Modifies requirements regulating the distribution of appropriated amounts exceeding certain amounts appropriated for FY2003.<br/>
