	10/31/2007--Introduced.<br/>Unemployment Insurance for Survivors Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) to add as a condition for approval of a state unemployment compensation law that it does not deny unemployment compensation to individuals separated from employment because of circumstances resulting from the experience of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Prohibits states from imposing additional conditions restricting the individual's eligibility for or receipt of unemployment benefits beyond those required of other individuals forced to leave their jobs or deemed to have good cause for voluntary separating from a job. Amends title III (Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to prohibit the Secretary of Labor from providing grants to states for unemployment compensation administration unless: (1) unemployment compensation applicants are notified of the requirements of this Act; and (2) claims reviewers and hearing personnel are adequately trained in the nature and dynamics of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and in methods of ascertaining and keeping confidential information about such applicants' possible experiences. Amends SSA title IV part A (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) (TANF) to require a state TANF plan to require the state's chief officer to certify that the state has established and is enforcing standards and procedures to: (1) notify TANF applicants of the requirements of this Act and related assistance; and (2) ensure that TANF personnel receive adequate related training. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award development grants for model training programs under this Act to a national victim services organization and to state, tribal, or local agencies.
