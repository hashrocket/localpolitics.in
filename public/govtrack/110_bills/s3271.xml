	<summary>
	7/16/2008--Introduced.<br/>Revises the definition of &quot;commercial motor vehicle&quot; with respect to federal commercial motor vehicle safety laws to include vehicles primarily engaged in the transportation of agricultural commodities or farm supplies having a gross vehicle weight or gross vehicle weight of at least the minimum weight of a commercial motor vehicle as defined by the state. (Current law applies to vehicles having a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of at least 10,001 pounds, whichever is greater.)<br/>Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from withholding commercial motor vehicle safety improvement grants from a state solely because it authorizes drivers of farm vehicles having a gross vehicle weight of between 10,000 and 26,001 pounds to operate without complying with federal commercial motor vehicle safety laws.<br/>
