Requires the service member for whom the caregiving is provided to be performing service in support of a contingency operation or in situations for which hostile fire or imminent danger pay is authorized and to designate the caregiver for his or her family.<br/>Terminates the program on December 31, 2012.<br/>Provides for an offsetting reduction in FY2008 appropriations for the Department of Defense for research, development, test and evaluation.<br/>
