	8/3/2007--Introduced.<br/>Commends the President for establishing the U.S.-Saudi Strategic Dialogue. Expresses dismay that the Department of State did not originally include human rights as a topic of discussion. Applauds the President for stating that the &quot;United States will continue to press&quot; Saudi Arabia &quot;to give greater voice to their people.&quot; Concludes that the Strategic Dialogue is the logical mechanism through which to discuss the promotion of human rights in Saudi Arabia, and calls upon the President and the Secretary to expand the Strategic Dialogue and establish a new human rights working group.<br/>
