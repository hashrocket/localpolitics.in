	3/14/2007--Introduced.<br/>Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a five-year pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of awarding grants to eligible entities to assist members of the Armed Forces, particularly those with serious wounds, injuries, or mental disorders, women members, and members of the National Guard and reserves, in applying for and receiving health care benefits and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and otherwise after completion of military service, in order to ensure that such members receive a continuity of care and assistance in and after the transition from military service to civilian life. Requires at least one location of the pilot program to be in the vicinity of: (1) a military medical facility that treats members who are seriously wounded or injured in Afghanistan or Iraq; (2) a VA medical center located in a rural area; and (3) a VA medical center located in an urban area.<br/>
