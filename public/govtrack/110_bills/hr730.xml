	<summary>
	10/10/2007--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the planned acquisition of a minority interest in 3Com by affiliates of Huawei Technologies in China triggers a number of statutory national security factors to be considered by the President and members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to block a foreign acquisition; and (2) the preponderance of publicly available evidence suggests that such proposed acquisition threatens U.S. national security and should not be approved by CFIUS.<br/>
