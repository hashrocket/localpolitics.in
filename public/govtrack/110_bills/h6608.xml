	9/11/2008--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.) House Reservists Pay Adjustment Act - Requires the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the House of Representatives to pay an eligible House employee, who is also a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces, for each active duty month the amount by which the employee's regular compensation from the House would have exceeded (if at all) the total monthly military compensation paid to the employee for the active duty month by the Secretary of Defense. Limits employee eligibility for such adjusted compensation to those employed by the House each day of the 90 days ending on the day on which the employee reports for active duty under an involuntary mobilization order. Requires the CAO to reduce the amount of any payment to such employee for an active duty month by the amount of any pay and allowances received by the individual from any other source as replacement of lost income. Prohibits the CAO from making a required payment under this Act unless the payment, taking into account any reduction, is at least $50. Authorizes appropriations. Amends Rule XXIII (Code of Official Conduct) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to declare that nothing in such Rule may be construed to prohibit the disbursement or receipt of any payment authorized under this Act. Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriation Act, 1955 to declare that nothing in the Act may be construed to prohibit the CAO from paying a gratuity to the widow, widower, or heirs-at-law of a House employee who dies during an active duty month.<br/>
