	6/6/2007--Introduced.<br/>High Threat Helicopter Flight Area Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to designate an area at high risk for an attack by one or more terrorists as a high threat helicopter flight area. Directs the Secretary to provide screening of all passengers and property transported from a high threat flight helicopter area on a passenger helicopter equivalent to that provided for passengers and property carried aboard a domestic passenger aircraft. Requires the Secretary to develop a plan for acquiring and training personnel, including acquiring equipment, to provide such screening. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to take necessary action to ensure that: (1) no passenger helicopter flies in a high threat flight area, except on approach for landing, or departure after takeoff, in such area; (2) a passenger helicopter when flying in such area, to the maximum extent practicable, flies over water; and (3) a helicopter pilot when in flight over such area remains in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding its flight path, irrespective of its altitude. Exempts from such requirement helicopters carrying out military, police, medical, or other operations as the Secretary of Transportation deems appropriate.<br/>
