	<summary>
	1/31/2007--Introduced.<br/>Declares that the existence of racially restrictive covenants in housing documents is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Commends: (1) California for taking a lead role in removing such covenants from housing documents; and (2) the states of Kansas and Washington, and the Missouri State Senate, for passing legislation to do so too. Urges the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to: (1) disseminate information regarding the removal of racially restrictive covenants from housing documents; (2) report to Congress on the number of complaints regarding such covenants; and (3) include the number of such covenants in the annual Fair Housing Report of data on each state. Urges states to enact laws that: (1) will more readily permit property owners to remove racially restrictive covenants from their property documents; and (2) require homeowner associations to strike such covenants from governing documents.<br/>
