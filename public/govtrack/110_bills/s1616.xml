	<summary>
	6/13/2007--Introduced.<br/>Biodiesel Promotion and Quality Assurance Act of 2007 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to ensure that diesel fuel sold in the United States contains the volume of biodiesel specified for 2008 through 2012. Requires the Administrator to determine the volume for 2013 and thereafter based on a review of the program. Requires at least 80% of the minimum applicable volume for each of 2008 through 2012 to be biodiesel.<br/>Requires the biodiesel fuel standards to contain compliance provisions applicable to refineries, blenders, distributors, and importers. Prohibits such standards from restricting geographic areas in which biodiesel may be used or imposing any per-gallon obligation for the use of biodiesel.<br/>Authorizes the Administrator to reduce the quantity of biodiesel required by a specified amount if market circumstances would make the price of biodiesel fuel unreasonable.<br/>Exempts diesel fuel subject to a state biodiesel mandate enacted as of January 1, 2007. Prohibits states or local governments from establishing or enforcing a requirement that the level of production or use of biodiesel or bio-based diesel replacement exceed the maximum level described in any engine warranty or specification derived in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM). Requires the Administrator to: (1) promulgate regulations to ensure that only high-quality biodiesel that is consistent with appropriate ASTM International standards is introduced into commerce; and (2) establish an inspection program to ensure that biodiesel and biodiesel blends entering commerce meet such standards. Prohibits the production of distribution of biodiesel, a biodiesel blend, or any bio-based diesel replacement that does not meet ASTM standards, regardless of whether the Administrator promulgates such regulations.<br/>Requires retail diesel fuel pumps to be labeled to inform consumers of the percent of biodiesel in the biodiesel blend.
