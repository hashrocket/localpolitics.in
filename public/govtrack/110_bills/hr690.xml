	<summary>
	9/27/2007--Introduced.<br/>Demands that all provisions of U.N. Resolutions be implemented including that: (1) Hezbollah release Israel Defense Force soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, as mandated by U.N. Resolution 1701; (2) Hezbollah and other armed Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias groups disband and disarm as required by U.N. Resolutions 1559 and 1701; and (3) the arms embargo be strictly enforced. Expresses: (1) commitment to the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers; (2) support for the government of Lebanon's asserting of sovereignty throughout its territory, particularly in the South; (3) support for the U.N. mandated UNIFIL troops; (4) support for a democratic Lebanon, with disarmed Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias; and (5) concern that the international community's failure to live up to its commitments to stop Hezbollah's rearmament could again lead to war. Condemns Iran and Syria for: (1) their ongoing violation of U.N. Resolutions 1701 and 1559, especially in re-arming Hezbollah; and (2) sponsoring, financing, and arming terrorist organizations internationally and within Lebanon.<br/>
