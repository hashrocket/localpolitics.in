	5/3/2007--Introduced.<br/>Veterans' Justice Assurance Act of 2007 - Repeals, for judges appointed after the enactment of this Act, the 15-year term limit for members of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). Increases the annual salary for the Court's chief judge. Eliminates the 180-day per-year limit on service of retired Court judges who voluntarily return to such service. Requires recalled judges to receive the pay of current judges only during the period of recall, less the amount of any applicable annuity. Prohibits recall service in excess of five years for judges who are recalled involuntarily. Requires the chief judge to establish guidelines for determining whether recall-eligible judges should be recalled on either a voluntary or involuntary basis. Removes the $30 annual limit on practice and registration fees for those admitted to practice before the Court. Requires an annual report from the chief judge to the congressional veterans' committees summarizing the Court's workload. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Court should be provided with appropriate office space, without undue disruption, inconvenience, or cost. Requires a report from the Administrator of General Services to the veterans' committees on the feasibility of leasing additional space for the Court, and using the entire building in which the Court is now housed as a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center.
