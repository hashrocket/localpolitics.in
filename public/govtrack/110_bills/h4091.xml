	11/6/2007--Introduced.<br/>Adoption Equality Act of 2007 - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to revise requirements for children with special needs in the adoption assistance program. Requires that the child be in the care of a public or licensed private child placement agency or Indian tribal organization pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, relinquishment, or involuntary removal of the child from the home, where the state has determined that continuation in the home would be contrary to the child's safety or welfare. Specifies related requirements.<br/>Prohibits adoption assistance to parents with respect to a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, and who was adopted outside of the United States or brought into the United States for the purposes of being adopted.<br/>Expresses the sense of the Congress that the states should reinvest in child welfare programs any savings resulting from the implementation of this Act.
