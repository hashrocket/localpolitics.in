	3/22/2007--Introduced.<br/>Federal Supervisor Training Act of 2007 - Revises provisions relating to specific training programs for federal agency supervisors. Requires the head of each federal agency to establish: (1) a program to provide interactive instructor-based training to supervisors on developing and discussing relevant goals and objectives with the employee, communicating and discussing progress on performance goals and objectives and conducting performance appraisals, mentoring and motivating employees and improving employee performance and productivity, effectively managing employees with unacceptable performance, and addressing reports of a hostile work environment, reprisal, or harassment; (2) a program to provide training to supervisors on prohibited personnel practices and processes to enforce employee rights; and (3) a program under which experienced supervisors mentor new supervisors. Requires supervisors to complete such programs every three years.<br/>Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue guidance to federal agencies on standards supervisors are expected to meet in order to effectively manage, and be accountable for managing, the performance of employees. Requires each agency to: (1) develop standards to assess the performance of each supervisor and, in developing such standards, to consider such guidance developed by OPM and any other qualifications or factors determined by the agency; (2) assess the overall capacity of the supervisors in the agency to meet such guidance; and (3) develop and implement a supervisor training program to strengthen issues identified during such assessment. Instructs each agency, every year or on any basis requested by the Director of OPM, to submit a report to OPM on the progress of such agency in implementing the requirements specified above with respect to developing those standards.<br/>
