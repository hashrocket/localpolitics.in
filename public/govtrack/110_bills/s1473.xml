	5/24/2007--Introduced.<br/>Madera Water Supply Enhancement Act - Finds that: (1) the Bureau of Reclamation and others have conducted numerous studies regarding the Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project, California; (2) the Project is feasible; and (3) the Bureau shall not conduct any further studies or reports related to determining its feasibility. Requires all planning, design, and construction of the Project to be undertaken in accordance with a cooperative agreement between the Secretary and the Madera Irrigation District. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement for the support of Project design and construction. Limits the federal share of Project capital costs to 25%. Considers: (1) capital, planning, design, permitting, financing, construction, and land acquisition costs incurred by the District prior to this Act's enactment to be part of the nonfederal share; and (2) in-kind services performed by the District to be part of the local share. Requires the District to receive credit toward the nonfederal share for reasonable costs incurred from participation in the planning, design, permitting, financing, and construction of the Project and for the fair market value of lands used or acquired for the Project. Prohibits the Secretary from providing funds for operation or maintenance. Makes Project operation, ownership, and maintenance the sole responsibility of the District. Directs the Secretary, before obligating funds, to work cooperatively with the District to use plans, designs, and engineering and environmental analyses that have already been prepared by the District. Terminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this Act 10 years after its enactment.
