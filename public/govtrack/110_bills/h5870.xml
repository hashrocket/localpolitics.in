Requires the use of such grant to fund: (1) the demolition of vacant and abandoned housing, and other vacant and abandoned structures, located in areas that are primarily residential in character; (2) the abatement, before demolition, of any health and safety hazards within such housing or structures, or on the site upon which such housing or other structures are located; and (3) the capping or removal, after demolition, of utility connections and public infrastructure, including street pavements and sewer lines, and the rehabilitation of a site for use as public open space, inclusion in a land bank, or for sale.
