	1/4/2007--Introduced.<br/>Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act - Establishes a national policy to protect, maintain, and restore the health of marine ecosystems and requires that federal agencies administer U.S. policies and laws accordingly. Allows more stringent federal and state requirements. States that there shall be an agency known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), declares that Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 (concerning NOAA) shall have no further force or effect, and sets forth NOAA's mission and functions. (Reestablishes NOAA and requires a reorganization plan.) Creates an Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and makes that person the Administrator of NOAA. Requires maintenance within NOAA of: (1) the National Weather Service; (2) programs to protect, maintain, and restore the health and sustainability of coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes resources; (3) the Office of Education; and (4) a Science Advisory Board. Establishes: (1) a National Oceans Advisor; (2) a Committee on Ocean Policy; and (3) the Council of Advisors on Oceans Policy. Designates certain ocean regions for ecosystem-based management and establishes a Regional Ocean Partnership for each region. Requires the Administrator to establish a network of regional ocean ecosystem resource information systems for each ocean region and other specified bodies of water. Authorizes related contracts. Establishes in the Treasury the Ocean and Great Lakes Conservation Trust Fund. Requires payments to coastal states for development and implementation of Regional Ocean Strategic Plans. Requires the U.S. Postal Service to provide for a special postage stamp to afford the public a convenient way to support efforts to protect, maintain, and restore marine ecosystems.<br/>
