	9/22/2008--Introduced.<br/>Air Carriage of International Mail Act - Authorizes the U.S. Postal Service to contract, through an open procurement process, for air transportation of mail between foreign points only with certificated air carriers (carriers that hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under specified provisions). Allows a contract to be awarded to transport mail between any foreign points the Secretary of Transportation has authorized the carrier to serve either directly or through a code-share relationship. Provides for exceptions for emergency or unanticipated conditions. Removes provisions requiring that the Secretary of Transportation set prices to be paid by the Postal Service for the transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation. Removes references to foreign air transportation from provisions relating to a duty to provide certain transportation of mail. Authorizes the Postal Service to weigh mail transported by aircraft between places in Alaska and make statistical and administrative computations necessary in the interest of mail service. (Current law does not restrict that authorization to flights between places in Alaska.) Removes a requirement that the Postal Service make a fair and equitable distribution of mail business to carriers providing similar modes of transportation. Modifies provisions regarding the mail of members of the U.S. Armed Forces and of friendly foreign nations.<br/>
