	10/29/2007--Passed House amended. Commends the efforts of the U.S. public and advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening humanitarian crisis and genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Supports the efforts of the various local schools, communities, and faith-based, human rights, humanitarian, and youth-led advocacy organizations that have dedicated their time and energy to help end the Darfur genocide and to promote peace, defend human rights, and improve the lives of those affected in Sudan and Chad. Urges the United States to work with its partners in the international community to support a negotiated settlement to the Darfur conflict while implementing a more robust set of multilateral measures against those individuals who act as obstructionists to peace in Darfur.
