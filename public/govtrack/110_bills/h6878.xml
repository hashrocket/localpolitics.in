	9/11/2008--Introduced.<br/>Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2008 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to recognized independent accreditation organizations which apply quality standards to which suppliers of items and services relating to prosthetic devices and orthotics and prosthetics. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to designate and approve an independent accreditation organization for such purposes only if it is the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, Inc., the Board for Orthotist/Prosthetist Certification, or a program that the Secretary determines has accreditation and approval standards essentially equivalent to those of such a Board. Requires application to prosthetic devices and orthotics and prosthetics generally of existing accreditation and licensure requirements for certain prosthetics and custom-fabricated orthotics. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on: (1) the steps taken by the Department of HHS to ensure that such licensure and accreditation requirements are enforced; and (2) the effect of the requirements of this Act on the occurrence of fraud and abuse under the Medicare program with respect to prosthetic devices and orthotics and prosthetics. Modifies the Medicare payment methodology for prosthetic devices and orthotics and prosthetics to account for practitioner qualifications and complexity of care.<br/>
