Requires the Commission to notify the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of General Services, the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, and certain congressional committees of any boundary modification made under such authority. Allows the Secretary or the Administrator to submit a recommendation to Congress that the legislative authority for a commemorative work be terminated before the expiration date of the legislative authority applicable to the work, if the person authorized to establish the work does not possess the capacity and resources to successfully complete the project for the establishment of the work before that expiration date. Directs: (1) the Commission to prepare recommendations for improving upon the process required for the selection, design, and subject matter of commemorative works in the District of Columbia and its environs; and (2) the Secretary to submit a plan to enhance visitor enjoyment, amenities, cultural experiences in, and the vitality of the National Mall.
