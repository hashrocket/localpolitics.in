	2/7/2007--Introduced.<br/>Pigford Claims Remedy Act of 2007 - Declares that any Pigford claimant (relating to a racial discrimination action against the Department of Agriculture) who has not obtained a determination on the merits of a Pigford claim before enactment of this Act may, in a civil action, obtain that determination. Asserts that it is Congress' intent that this Act be liberally construed so as to effectuate its remedial purpose of giving a full determination on the merits for each denied Pigford claim. Defines: (1) &quot;Pigford claimant&quot; as an individual who submitted, before enactment of this Act, a late-filing request under the consent decree in the case of Pigford v. Glickman (1999); and (2) &quot;Pigford claim&quot; as a discrimination complaint as defined and documented by such consent decree.<br/>
