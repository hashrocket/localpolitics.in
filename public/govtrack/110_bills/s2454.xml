Prohibits a provider from publishing (listing) in any form, selling, or otherwise distributing the contents of any WDAS database unless the provider: (1) notifies the subscriber of the right not to be listed; and (2) obtains express prior authorization for listing from such subscriber, and that authorization has not been withdrawn. Prohibits a provider from charging a subscriber for the exercise of any rights under this Act. Prohibits selling, marketing for sale, or otherwise disseminating the wireless telephone information of any individual, or any directory or other list of such information of individuals, unless each such individual provides written express prior authorization.
