	10/29/2007--Introduced.<br/>Urban Health Care Delivery Act of 2007 - Revises requirements for adjustments in payments made by a state under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act for inpatient hospital services furnished by a disproportionate share hospital (DSH). Provides that DSH payment adjustments made by a state to a state- or local government- owned or operated hospital providing up to 450 inpatient beds, and meeting certain other criteria, shall be made without regard, and in addition, to the standard DSH allotment limitation on federal financial participation. Caps such adjustments at 175% of the costs of furnishing such services. Prescribes criteria for such a hospital, including operation of a community mental health center, a burn center serving the entire state, and a Level I trauma center with at least 100,000 encounters per year.
