	8/2/2007--Introduced.<br/>Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to carry out a project for the repair and reconstruction of the Interstate I-35 bridge located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that collapsed on August 1, 2007. Makes the federal share of the project cost 100%. Authorizes appropriations. Waives, for such project, the $100 million per state single-failure (or, single-disaster) highway-related total obligation limitation. Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users to authorize the Secretary to use such single-failure (or, single-disaster) highway-related funds to reimburse the Minnesota state department of transportation for actual and necessary costs of maintenance and operation (less the amount of fares earned) for additional public transportation services and traveler information services it provides as a temporary substitute for highway traffic service following the bridge collapse, until highway traffic service is restored on such bridge. Sets the federal share of the cost of reimbursed activities at 100%.<br/>
