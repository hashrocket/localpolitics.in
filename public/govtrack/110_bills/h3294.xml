	8/1/2007--Introduced.<br/>Promoting Wellness for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 2007 - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board to issue and periodically review standards setting forth the minimum technical criteria for medical diagnostic equipment used in medical settings, to ensure that such equipment: (1) is accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and (2) allows independent entry to, use of, and exit from the equipment by such individuals to the maximum extent possible. Applies such standards to examination tables and chairs, weight scales, mammography equipment, x-ray machines, and other radiological equipment commonly used for diagnostic purposes by health professionals. Sets forth interim standards for such equipment.<br/>Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants for programs to promote good health, disease prevention, and wellness for individuals with disabilities and prevent secondary conditions in such individuals. Requires the Secretary to establish a National Advisory Committee on Wellness for Individuals With Disabilities to set priorities to carry out such programs, review grant proposals, make recommendations for funding, and annually evaluate the progress of such programs in implementing the priorities.<br/>Provides for training programs to improve competency and clinical skills for providing health care and communicating with patients with disabilities through training integrated into the core curriculum and patient interaction in community-based settings.
