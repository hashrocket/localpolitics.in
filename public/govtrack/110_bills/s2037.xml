	9/11/2007--Introduced.<br/>Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to make it unlawful to sell a product that is: (1) not in conformity with an applicable consumer product safety standard; (2) subject to voluntary corrective action taken by the manufacturer and determined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to be unsafe; (3) subject to an order issued under provisions relating to imminent hazards or substantial product hazards; or (4) designated a banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Requires the manufacturer of a consumer product, regardless of whether it is subject to a consumer product safety standard, to place distinguishing marks on the product (as much as feasible), and on its packaging, that will enable the ultimate purchaser to determine the source, date, and cohort of production of the product by reference to those marks.<br/>
