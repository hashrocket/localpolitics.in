	7/16/2007--Introduced.<br/>Veterans Claims Processing Innovation Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a work credit system for evaluating regional offices of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) with respect to veterans' claims processing. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and maintain a system for processing veterans' disability compensation claims using artificial intelligence that utilizes medical and military service data to generate disability rating recommendations; and (2) maintain a regional office at which all such claims are processed exclusively electronically. Provides that if a veteran who is a claimant dies before completing the submission of a claim for benefits, the person who would receive any accrued benefit(s) due to such veteran shall be treated as the claimant for purposes of completing submission of the claim. Directs the Secretary to contract with a private entity to evaluate the training and assessment programs for VBA employees.<br/>
