	<summary>
	9/14/2007--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on July 31, 2007. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 - Title I: Closing the Revolving Door - (Sec. 101) Amends the federal criminal code to extend from one to two years the ban on lobbying contacts by former: (1) very senior executive personnel with any Member, officer, or employee of the entity in which such person served before his or her tenure terminated; and (2) Senators with any Member, officer or employee of either chamber, or employee of any other legislative office.<br/>Continues the one-year ban on lobbying contacts by former: (1) Members of the House of Representatives with any Member, officer, or employee of either chamber, or employee of any other legislative office; (2) elected officers of the House with any House Member, officer, or employee; and (3) Senate officers, or a Senate employee (who, for at least 60 days during the one-year period before such employee's service terminated, was paid a salary equal to or greater than 75% of a Senator's salary) with any Senator or Senate officer or employee.<br/>Provides that the one-year ban on lobbying contacts by former legislative office employees shall apply to employees who, for at least 60 days during the one-year before such employee's service terminated, was employed in a position for which his or her salary, exclusive of any locality-based pay adjustment (currently, or any comparable adjustment pursuant to interim authority of the President), is equal to or greater than the salary for level IV of the Executive Schedule (currently, level 5 of the Senior Executive Schedule).<br/>Excludes from such bans any contacts with the staff of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House regarding compliance with lobbying disclosure requirements under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA).<br/>Redefines &quot;employee of any other legislative office of Congress&quot; to exclude the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.<br/>(Sec. 102) Subjects to a fine or imprisonment of up to 15 years, or both, a Member of Congress or a congressional employee who with the intent to influence, solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an employment decision or employment practice of any private entity: (1) takes or withholds, or offers or threatens to take or withhold, an official act; or (2) influences, or offers or threatens to influence, the official act of another.<br/>Provides that such individual may be disqualified from holding any federal office of honor, trust, or profit.<br/>States that nothing in such prohibition shall be construed to create any inference regarding whether such activity was a criminal or civil offense before the enactment of this Act.<br/>(Sec. 103) Requires the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate, as appropriate, to: (1) notify former Members of Congress, officers, or congressional employees of post-employment restrictions; and (2) post the information contained in such notification on the Clerk's or Secretary's public Internet site.<br/>(Sec. 104) Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to authorize: (1) a federal officer or employee assigned to a tribal organization or an intertribal consortium to act as agent or attorney for, and appear on behalf of, such organization or consortium in connection with any matter related to a tribal governmental activity or federal Indian program or service pending before any department, agency, court, or commission, including any matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest; and (2) any former federal officer or employee who is carrying out official duties as an employee or as an elected or appointed official of a tribal organization or intertribal consortium to represent such entities in such matters.<br/>Title II: Full Public Disclosure of Lobbying - (Sec. 201) Amends the LDA to require: (1) quarterly instead of semiannual filing of lobbying disclosure reports; (2) identification after each client listing on a disclosure report of whether the client is a state or local government; and (3) semiannual reports on registered lobbyists' federal election-related political contributions.<br/>Requires the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate to report to Congress on the feasibility of requiring quarterly instead of semiannual reports on registered lobbyists' federal election-related political contributions.<br/>(Sec. 203) Expresses the sense of Congress that after the end of the two-year period beginning on the day on which the requirement for such semiannual reports first applies, they should be made on a quarterly basis if it is practicably feasible to do so.<br/>(Sec. 204) Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require an authorized committee of a candidate, a leadership PAC, or a political party committee to include in its disclosure report after each covered period a separate schedule setting forth the name, address, and employer of each person reasonably known by the committee to be a current registered lobbyist, an individual who is listed on a LDA registration or report, or a political committee established or controlled by such a registrant or individual who provided two or more bundled contributions to the committee in an aggregate amount greater than $15,000 (applicable threshold) during the covered period, and the aggregate amount of the bundled contributions provided by each such person during such period.<br/>Excludes any contribution made to the committee by the person or the person's spouse in determining whether the amount of such bundled contributions exceeds the applicable threshold.<br/>Requires the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that: (1) information about such bundled contribution is publicly available through the FEC website in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable manner; and (2) such public database is linked electronically to the websites maintained by the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House containing LDA reports and filings.<br/>Defines &quot;leadership PAC,&quot; with respect to a candidate for election to federal office or an individual holding federal office, as a political committee that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled by the candidate or the officeholder, but which is not an authorized committee of the candidate or officeholder, and is not affiliated with such an authorized committee. Excludes a political committee of a political party from the meaning of &quot;leadership PAC.&quot;<br/>(Sec. 205) Requires mandatory lobbyist reports to be filed electronically, in addition to any other form that the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House may require or allow. Requires them to use the same electronic software for receipt and recording of such filings.<br/>(Sec. 206) Amends the LDA to prohibit a registered lobbyist, any registered organization that employs one or more lobbyists, and any employee listed as a registered lobbyist from making a gift or providing travel to a covered legislative branch official, if such individual or organization has knowledge that the gift or travel may not be accepted under the rules of the House or the Senate.<br/>(Sec. 207) Revises requirements for the contents of lobbyist registrations, particularly disclosure of the identity of any organization, other than the client, that: (1) contributes over $5,000 to the registrant or the client in a quarterly period to fund the registrant's lobbying activities (currently, over $10,000 toward the registrant's lobbying activities in a semiannual period); and (2) participates actively in the planning, supervision, or control of such lobbying activities (currently, in whole or in major part plans, supervises, or controls such lobbying activities).<br/>Waives such disclosure if the organization that would be identified as affiliated with the client is listed on the client's publicly accessible Internet website as being a member of or contributor to the client, unless the organization in whole or in major part plans, supervises, or controls such lobbying activities. Provides that, if the registrant relies upon this general waiver, he or she must disclose the specific Internet address of the web page containing the information relied upon.<br/>(Sec. 208) Amends the requirements for the registration of a lobbyist to extend from two to 20 years the look-back period during which an employee of the lobbyist may have served as a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official.<br/>(Sec. 209) Requires the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, to the extent technically practicable, to maintain certain lobbying disclosure information in an electronic database, available to the public free of charge over the Internet.<br/>Authorizes appropriations.<br/>(Sec. 210) Requires the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House to make publicly available, semiannually, the aggregate number of registrants referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for LDA noncompliance.<br/>Requires the U.S. Attorney to report semiannually to specified congressional committees on the aggregate number of enforcement actions taken by the Department of Justice during such period and, by case, any sentence imposed, but not the names of individuals or personally identifiable information that is not already a matter of public record.<br/>(Sec. 211) Increases from $50,000 to $200,000 the civil penalty for failure to comply with LDA requirements.<br/>Subjects anyone who knowingly and corruptly fails to comply with LDA to imprisonment for up to five years or a specified fine, or both.<br/>(Sec. 212) Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to require electronic filing of mandatory registration statements or supplements, in addition to any other form that may be required by the Attorney General.<br/>Requires the Attorney General, to the extent technically practicable, to maintain an electronic database (in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable manner), available to the public free of charge over the Internet, that: (1) includes the information contained in registration statements and updates filed under FARA; and (2) is searchable and sortable, at a minimum, by each of the categories described in the registration statements.<br/>Requires the Attorney General to make such electronic statements and updates available for public inspection over the Internet as soon as technically practicable after such information is filed.<br/>(Sec. 213) Requires the Comptroller General to audit and report to Congress annually on the extent of LDA compliance or noncompliance by lobbyists, lobbying firms, and registrants through a random sampling of publicly available annual LDA lobbying registrations and reports.<br/>(Sec. 214) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the use of a family relationship by a lobbyist who is an immediate family member of a Member of Congress to gain special advantages over other lobbyists is inappropriate; and (2) the lobbying community should develop proposals for multiple self-regulatory organizations which could provide for creation of standards, legal and ethical training, development of educational materials for the public on how to responsibly hire a lobbyist or lobby firm, standards for reasonable client fees, creation of a third-party certification program including ethics training, and disclosure to clients of fee schedule requirements and conflict of interest rules. Title III: Matters Relating to the House of Representatives - (Sec. 301) Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to add Rule XXVII (Disclosure by Members and Staff of Employment Negotiations).<br/>Prohibits a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner (Member) from directly negotiating or having any agreement of future employment or compensation until after the election for his or her successor, unless such Member files a statement about such negotiations or agreement with the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct within three business days after their commencement. Requires inclusion in such a statement of: (1) the name of the private entity or entities involved in the negotiations or agreement; and (2) the commencement date.<br/>Requires a House officer or employee earning over 75% of the salary paid to a Member to notify the Committee, within three business days, that he or she is negotiating or has any agreement of future employment or compensation.<br/>Requires such Member, officer, or employee to recuse himself or herself from any matter in which there is or appears to be a conflict of interest under the Rule, and to notify the Committee of such recusal. Requires such individual also to submit to the Clerk of the House, for public disclosure, the statement of disclosure for which such recusal was made.<br/>(Sec. 302) Amends Rule XXV (Limitations on Outside Earned Income and Acceptance of Gifts) to require a Member of the House to prohibit all of his or her staff from making any lobbying contact with the Member's spouse if the spouse is a registered lobbyist or is employed or retained by a registered lobbyist to influence legislation.<br/>(Sec. 303) Amends Rule XXIII (Code of Official Conduct) to subject other members and employees of a firm, partnership, or other business organization to the same lobbying restrictions that apply to a member or employee acting under contract as a consultant to a House committee (treated by this Rule as a House employee).<br/>(Sec. 304) Requires the Clerk of the House, to the extent technically practicable, to: (1) post certain travel and financial disclosure reports on the public Internet site of the Clerk's Office in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable format; and (2) maintain such information for at least six years.<br/>Permits Members of the House to omit certain personally identifiable information from the reports before such posting.<br/>Requires the Clerk of the House to include in any informational materials about website disclosures an explanation of the procedures for protecting such personally identifiable information.<br/>(Sec. 305) Prohibits a Member, during the dates on which the Member's national political party holds its convention to nominate a candidate for President or Vice President, from participating in an event honoring him or her, other than in his or her capacity as a candidate for such office, if such event is directly paid for by a registered lobbyist or a private entity that retains or employs such lobbyist.<br/>Title IV: Congressional Pension Accountability - (Sec. 401) Amends federal civil service law regarding the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) to exclude from retirement accounting any service as a Member of Congress of an individual finally convicted of a felony involving: (1) bribery of public officials and witnesses; (2) acting as an agent of a foreign principal while a federal public official; (3) fraud by wire, radio, or television, including as part of a scheme to deprive citizens of honest services; (4) prohibited foreign trade practices by domestic concerns; (5) engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity; (6) tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant; (7) racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations; (8) conspiracy to commit an offense or to defraud the United States; (9) perjury; or (10) subornation of perjury. Entitles such individual, all the same, to so much of his or her lump-sum credit as is attributable to such service.<br/>Requires, with respect to each offense, that: (1) every act or commission of the individual that is needed to satisfy the elements of the offense occurs while the individual is a Member; (2) such act or omission directly relates to the performance of the individual's official duties as a Member; and (3) the offense is committed after enactment of this Act.<br/>Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations to ensure that the authority to make any payment to the spouse or children of an individual pursuant to this title shall be available only to the extent that the application of such regulation is considered necessary and appropriate, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the financial needs of the spouse or children; (2) whether the spouse or children participated in a specified offense of which such individual was finally convicted; and (3) what measures, if any, may be necessary to ensure that the convicted individual does not benefit from any such payment.<br/>Defines &quot;Member&quot; as the Vice President, a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives, a Delegate to the House of Representatives, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico.<br/>Title V: Senate Legislative Transparency and Accountability - Subtitle A: Procedural Reform - (Sec. 511) Amends Rule XXVIII (Conference Committees; Reports; Open Meetings) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to revise procedures for disposal of points of order against consideration of: (1) new matter inserted in a conference report; or (2) the conference report when conferees violate specified requirements regarding a disagreement to an amendment in the nature of a substitute referred to them.<br/>Requires: (1) an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Members of the Senate to waive any or all of such points of order; and (2) the same three-fifths affirmative vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on them. Requires all motions to waive such points of order and to sustain such appeal to be debatable collectively and limited to one hour equally divided between the Majority and Minority Leaders or their designees.
