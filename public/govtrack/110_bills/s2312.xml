	11/6/2007--Introduced.<br/>Amends title VI (Flexibility and Accountability) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to set forth a new Part C: State Student Achievement Contracts. Allows the Secretary of Education to enter into five-year student achievement contracts with up to 12 states, authorizing them to: (1) waive the statutory or regulatory requirements that accompany any ESEA formula grant program for states; (2) use funds, or allow their local educational agencies (LEAs) to use funds, received under specified ESEA programs for implementing one or more of such programs or programs under part A of title I of the ESEA; and (3) require their LEAs that are not meeting state student proficiency targets to use such funds for corrective intervention activities. Requires contract applicants to demonstrate that their academic standards, assessments, accountability systems, objectives, and data systems meet specified minimum requirements under such contracts. Establishes alternative ESEA program waivers for states participating in the contract program that do not meet such minimum academic standards and assessment requirements but have a plan, approved by the Secretary, for doing so. Requires participating states to report annually on how they have used federal funds under the contract to improve academic achievement, narrow the achievement gap, and improve educational opportunities for the disadvantaged. Provides for the early termination of program participation by states not abiding by the terms of their contracts. Requires an independent five-year evaluation of this program's success in improving student academic achievement.<br/>
