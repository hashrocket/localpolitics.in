Expands the state home grant program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to authorize grants for noninstitutional care programs. Requires, for fiscal years after 2007, that not less than 10% of sums appropriated for VA home construction grants be used for grants to states which have submitted applications for noninstitutional care projects.<br/>
