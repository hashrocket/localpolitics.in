	9/16/2008--Reported to Senate amended. Bountiful City Land Consolidation Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, if the city of Bountiful, Utah, conveys three parcels of land consisting of a total of approximately 1,680 acres to the Secretary, to convey to the city, in exchange for such land, certain federal land identified as Shooting Range Special Use Permit Area on the map entitled &quot;Bountiful City Land Consolidation Act, &quot; dated October 15, 2007 (the federal land). Requires the value of the federal and non-federal lands to be conveyed to be: (1) equal; or (2) if not equal, to be equalized by making a cash equalization payment to the Secretary or the city, or by reducing the acreage of the federal land or non-federal land to be exchanged. Allows the Secretary to accept a cash equalization payment in excess of 25% of the value of the federal land. Requires the city to: (1) assume all liability for the shooting range on the federal land, including the past, present, and future condition of the land; (2) hold the United States harmless for any liability for the condition of the land; and (3) comply with requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) with regard to the notification in contracts for the sale or other transfer of real property owned by the United States of any hazardous substance that was stored for a year or more, known to have been released, or disposed of on such property. Excludes the conveyance of the federal land from requirements under CERCLA for the deeds for the transfer of such property to contain: (1) a covenant warranting that all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to any such substance remaining on the property has been taken before the transfer and any additional action found to be necessary after the transfer shall be conducted by the United States; and (2) a clause granting the United States access to such property in which remedial or corrective action is found to be necessary after the transfer. Requires the non-federal land acquired by the Secretary to be added to and administered as part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. Instructs the Secretary to ensure that an easement of not less than 60 feet in width is reserved for the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. Permits the Secretary and the city to reserve any other rights-of-way for utilities, roads, and trails that are mutually agreed to and considered to be in the public interest. Authorizes the Secretary, by sale or exchange, to dispose of all or a portion of certain National Forest System land comprising approximately 220 acres after the conveyance of the federal land authorized for exchange under this Act, if the land or portion of the land is in excess of the needs of the National Forest System. Specifies that such a determination be made: (1) pursuant to an amendment of the land and resource management plan for the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; and (2) after carrying out a public process consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Instructs the Secretary to require payment of an amount equal to not less than the fair market value of the conveyed National Forest System land. Sets forth requirements for the disposition of the proceeds of any amounts received as consideration under this Act.
