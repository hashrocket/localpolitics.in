National Environment and Energy Development Act - Declares without force or effect all federal prohibitions against the expenditure of appropriated funds to conduct natural gas leasing and preleasing activities for any area of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Revokes all withdrawals of federal submerged lands from leasing for natural gas exploration and production. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from: (1) granting a natural gas lease for any OCS located within 25 miles of a state coastline; (2) issuing any lease for natural gas exploration or development in any OCS area within 50 miles of a state coastline unless the state has enacted a law approving such lease; or (3) issuing a lease for natural gas exploration or development in any OCS area more than 50 and less than 100 miles from the coastline of a state if the state has enacted a law disapproving such lease issuance. Authorizes the Secretary to issue leases for development and production of natural gas and associated condensate. American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to implement a competitive leasing program for the exploration, development, and production of the oil and gas resources on the Coastal Plain of Alaska. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal the prohibition against leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Deems any oil and gas leasing programs and activities authorized by this Act to be in compliance with ANWR purposes. Authorizes the Secretary, after certain consultation, to designate up to 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as a Special Area. Permits directional drilling in the Special Area. Prescribes procedures governing Coastal Plain lease sales, including: (1) environmental protection; (2) federal and state distribution of revenues; (3) rights-of-way; and (4) local government impact aid and community service assistance. Sets forth: (1) a &quot;no significant adverse effect&quot; standard to govern Coastal Plain activities; and (2) guidelines for expedited judicial review of complaints.
