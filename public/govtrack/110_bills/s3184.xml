	6/24/2008--Introduced.<br/>Empowering Teaching and Learning Through Education Portals Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award matching grants to states to implement or maintain education portal initiatives that include collecting and making available: (1) high quality resources (including data, tools, and digital media content) for teachers, students, and parents, that support public education from Head Start through graduate school; and (2) resources for ongoing and sustainable teacher training in the use of education technology at such educational levels. Allows teachers, students, and parents to contribute resources to their state portal, which is to be accessible statewide. Permits states to use funds available to them under part A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to maintain such initiatives after their receipt of this Act's funding ends. Requires the Secretary to hold a conference, at least biennially, for state advisory panels on education portal initiatives to share information on best practices. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) count corporate contributions to such initiatives separately from other corporate contributions in applying charitable contribution deductibility limits; and (2) allow corporate deductions for contributions to such initiatives to reach 50% of a corporation's taxable income.<br/>
