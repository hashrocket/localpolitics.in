	10/15/2007--Introduced.<br/>Citizenship and Immigration Backlog Reduction Act - Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly provide to the appropriate congressional committees a plan for ensuring that within 18 months of the date of enactment of this Act the National Name Check Program will no longer have any requested name checks from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in backlog status (as defined by this Act). States that beginning 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act the Program is not authorized to have any file in backlog status. Provides that after such date any name check request from USCIS held by the Program for longer than six months shall: (1) be referred to the Secretary who shall adjudicate interim benefits (unless there is reasonable cause to suspect that the applicant poses a threat to national security, otherwise poses a threat to the United States, or has broken U.S. immigration law); and (2) have the name check fee refunded.
