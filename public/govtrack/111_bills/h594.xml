	1/15/2009--Introduced.<br/>Save Our Climate Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on the carbon content of any taxable fuel sold by a manufacturer, producer, or importer. Sets the amount of such tax at $10 per ton of the carbon content in such fuel, with annual increases in the amount of such tax until the second year after the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States for the calendar year does not exceed 20% of the level for 1990. Defines &quot;taxable fuel&quot; as coal (including lignite and peat), petroleum and any petroleum product, and natural gas. Exempts from such tax the sale or in-kind exchange of fuel for deposit in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and certain exports or resales of such fuel.<br/>
