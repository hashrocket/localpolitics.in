	<summary>
	2/12/2009--Introduced.<br/>Sole Community Hospital Preservation Act of 2009 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to the prospective payment system (PPS) for hospital outpatient department (OPD) services, particularly the transitional adjustment for sole community hospitals to limit any decline in payment. Continues to hold sole community hospitals harmless from any decline in payment. Increases the payment for covered OPD services furnished on or after January 1, 2010, in a sole community hospital by the amount of any difference between the pre-Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (pre-BBA) amount and a lesser PPS amount. Prescribes an increase of 7.1% in payment for such services (before the application of outliers and coinsurance). Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise such percentage based on a study comparing costs incurred by sole community hospitals located in rural areas by ambulatory payment classification groups (APCs) to costs incurred by hospitals located in urban areas. Bars any such increase in payment for devices, drugs, or biologicals.<br/>
