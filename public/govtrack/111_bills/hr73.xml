	1/21/2009--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) observes the 80th birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.; and (2) pledges to advance Dr. King's legacy. Encourages the people of the United States to: (1) observe Dr. King's 80th birthday and his life; (2) commemorate his legacy so that, as Dr. King hoped, &quot;one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: `We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal'&quot;; and (3) remember Dr. King's message and rededicate themselves to his goal of a free and just United States.<br/>
