	1/15/2009--Introduced.<br/>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the Agreement Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq on the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and the Organization of Their Activities During Their Temporary Presence in Iraq is not a genuine Status of Forces Agreement and lacks the force of law because it was formalized in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of the U.S. Constitution; (2) Congress should consider the Agreement to be advisory in nature; and (3) the House should conduct hearings related to funding the Agreement and related to the status of persons held in preventive detention or designated as protected persons.<br/>
