	<summary>
	1/22/2009--Introduced.<br/>Access to Postal Services Act - Modifies the procedures the U.S. Postal Service must follow in connection with the closing or consolidation of any postal facility, including: (1) requiring an assessment of the need for the closure or consolidation; (2) eliminating a requirement to consider the resulting Postal Service economic savings; (3) requiring a posting in each affected postal facility at least 90 days before the final decision is made; and (4) requiring (under current law, allowing) suspension of the determination pending an appeal to the Postal Regulatory Commission. Exempts emergency suspensions (as defined under Postal Service regulations) or lease termination or cancellation by a party other than the Postal Service. Defines &quot;postal facility,&quot; for the provisions amended by this Act, to include an office, branch, station, or other facility operated by the Postal Service.<br/>
