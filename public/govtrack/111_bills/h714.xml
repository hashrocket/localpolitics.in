	<summary>
	1/27/2009--Introduced.<br/>Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, if the long-term benefit to the Virgin Islands National Park would be greater by entering into a lease than by authorizing a concession contract, to enter into a lease for the operation and management of the Caneel Bay resort on the island in the Park. Allows the Secretary to acquire associated property. Requires the Secretary to submit a proposed lease to specified congressional committees at least 60 days before the effective date of such lease. Sets forth the terms and conditions for the lease authorized by this Act. Makes rental amounts paid to the United States under the lease available for visitor services and resource protection within the Virgin Islands National Park.<br/>
