	<summary>
	2/11/2009--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Produced Water Utilization Act of 2009 - Defines &quot;produced water&quot; to mean water from an underground source that is brought to the surface as part of the process of exploration for or development of coalbed methane, oil, natural gas, or any other substance to be used as an energy source. Requires the Secretary of Energy, in conjunction with an existing domestic petroleum production program of the Department of Energy (DOE), to conduct a program of research, development, and demonstration of technologies for environmentally sustainable utilization of produced water for agriculture, irrigation, municipal, or industrial uses or other environmentally sustainable purposes. Requires the program to be designed to maximize the utilization of produced water in the United States by increasing its quality and reducing its environmental impacts. Requires that the program address: (1) produced water recovery, including research for desalination and demineralization to reduce total dissolved solids in the produced water; (2) re-injection of produced water into subsurface geological formations to increase energy production; and (3) improving safety and minimizing environmental impacts of such activities.<br/>Requires the Secretary, through the appropriate National Laboratory, to carry out research, development, and demonstration activities that are complementary to and supportive of such program.<br/>Authorizes appropriations.<br/>
