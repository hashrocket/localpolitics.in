Establishes the Office of the United States Inspector General for Contributions to the United Nations System. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of a U.S. contribution to any U.N. entity unless the entity has provided the Inspector General with a transparency certification and is in compliance with such certification. Directs the Secretary to audit and report to the appropriate congressional committees respecting duplicative entities and efforts related to Israeli-Palestinian issues. Withholds funds for such entities until any report recommendations are implemented. Directs the President to use U.S. influence at the United Nations with respect to: (1) publication of all U.N. subsidiary bodies and their functions, budgets, staff, and contributions; (2) employee, agency, and funding financial disclosure; (3) waiver of immunity; (4) adoption of a definition of terrorism and a comprehensive convention on terrorism; (5) anti-Semitism at the United Nations; and (6) Israel's inclusion in the Western European and Others Group. Directs the President to use U.S. influence at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to: (1) establish an Office of Compliance in the Secretariat of the IAEA; and (2) prohibit Iran's access to nuclear material, technology, equipment, or assistance until the IAEA determines that Iran is providing full access to IAEA inspectors and has permanently ceased and dismantled all nuclear-enrichment and reprocessing activities. Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding U.N. reforms and personnel. Withholds annual U.S. contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) until certain conditions are certified, and then provides UNRWA with limited contributions.
