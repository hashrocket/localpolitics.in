	<summary>
	1/9/2009--Introduced.<br/>Safe Access in Fire Emergencies Act of 2009 - Requires the Consumer Products Safety Commission to establish a consumer product safety standard for window bars that: (1) requires all window bars manufactured or installed in the United States to incorporate releasing systems that meet minimum standards; and (2) addresses such systems for interior and exterior based bars. Provides that the minimum standards shall require that such systems provide for: (1) egress when actuated; and (2) manual activation from inside a residence allowing escape through a protected opening. Requires compliance enforcement under the Consumer Products Safety Act. Directs the Commission to require each manufacturer to include in the packaging a statement explaining window bar installation and releasing system operation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that public housing, low-income housing, manufactured housing units, and homes purchased using any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under the National Housing Act should meet a minimal standard that requires window bars to incorporate an emergency releasing system. Requires the Commission to establish and maintain a National Electronic Injury Surveillance System code and system for collection of information and statistics on casualties associated with window bars.<br/>
