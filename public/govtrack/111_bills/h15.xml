	1/6/2009--Introduced.<br/>National Health Insurance Act - Requires that medical services, hospital services, and other personal health services be made available to eligible individuals in all U.S. health-service areas as rapidly as possible. Sets forth minimum income requirements for eligibility. Allows health care professionals and hospitals to enter into agreements to furnish services to eligible individuals. Gives responsibility for administration of the benefits provided under this Act to local administrative committees or officers. Allows a state to assume responsibility for administration of the personal health benefits provided under this Act. Establishes: (1) the National Health Insurance Board in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); and (2) the National Advisory Medical Policy Council. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine the eligibility of any individual for benefits under this Act. Limits benefits under this Act for an individual to only those services for which the individual is not eligible under Medicare. Requires the Board to: (1) determine the sums to be made available for the provision of personal health-service benefits; and (2) allot amounts to each state based on population, available professional services and facilities, and the cost of compensation. Allows the Board to make grants for the training of professionals providing benefits under this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a value added tax of 5% on each sale of property, performance of services, and importation of property in the United States by a taxable person in a commercial-type transaction. Sets forth exceptions, including for food, housing, medical care, exports, interest, governmental entities, and certain tax-exempt organizations. Establishes the National Health Care Trust Fund and appropriates to it amounts equal to the revenue received by the Treasury from such tax.
