	1/8/2009--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Expresses commitment to the welfare and survival of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders and recognizes Israel's right to act in self-defense. Reiterates that Hamas must end the rocket and mortar attacks against Israel, recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, and agree to accept previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. Encourages the President to work to support a sustainable cease-fire in Gaza that prevents Hamas from retaining or rebuilding the capability to launch rockets and mortars against Israel and allows for the long term improvement of daily living conditions for Gaza's people. States that all appropriate measures should be taken to diminish civilian casualties. Supports efforts to diminish the influence of extremists in the Palestinian territories. Reiterates support for U.S. government efforts to promote a just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that leads to the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside a secure Israel.<br/>
