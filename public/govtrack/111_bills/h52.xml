	<summary>
	1/6/2009--Introduced.<br/>Tropical Forest and Coral Conservation Act - Amends the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 to make forests, coral reefs, and associated coastal marine ecosystem activities eligible for U.S. debt reduction benefits for developing countries. (Currently, such provision applies to tropical forests.) Renames: (1) the Tropical Forest Facility as the Conservation Facility; and (2) a Tropical Forest Agreement as a Conservation Agreement. Extends authorization of appropriations for debt reduction. Authorizes U.S. government representation on the administering body that oversees the implementation of grants arising from debt-for-nature swap or debt buy-back regardless of whether the United States is a party to any agreement between the purchaser and the beneficiary country government.<br/>
