Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to revise requirements concerning the enforcement of U.S. trade rights with respect to presidential authority and the responsibility of the USTR. Permits the USTR to take further action to enforce U.S. rights, based on the USTR's monitoring, when a petitioner considers that the actions of a foreign country in implementing a measure have not been satisfactory.<br/>
