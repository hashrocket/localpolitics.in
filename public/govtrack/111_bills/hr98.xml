	1/28/2009--Introduced.<br/>Amends Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to declare that, in the Committee of the Whole, before consideration of any other amendment to a bill making appropriations for the Department of the Treasury for any fiscal year, it shall be in order to consider an amendment only proposing to bar the automatic annual cost-of-living pay adjustment of Members of Congress that would otherwise take effect in such fiscal year. Makes it out of order to consider any legislation between the two chambers making or continuing appropriations to the end of a fiscal year that includes appropriations for the Department of the Treasury for that fiscal year, unless the measure includes a provision to bar such pay adjustment, or the rule providing for its consideration allows a vote proposing to bar it.
