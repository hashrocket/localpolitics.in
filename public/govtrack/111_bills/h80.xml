The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Captive Primate Safety Act - Amends the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to add nonhuman primates to the definition of &quot;prohibited wildlife species&quot; for purposes of the prohibition against the sale or purchase of such species in interstate or foreign commerce.<br/>Makes it unlawful for a person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase a live animal of any prohibited wildlife species in interstate or foreign commerce (i.e., for pet trade purposes).

Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act. Extends the authorization of appropriations to carry out such prohibition for FY2010-FY2014.<br/>Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for FY2010 to hire additional law enforcement personnel of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to enforce the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981.<br/>
