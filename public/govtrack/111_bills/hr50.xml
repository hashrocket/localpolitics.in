Honors the life, achievements, and distinguished career of Senator Claiborne Pell, a former member of the U.S. Senate. Emphasizes that, among his legislative accomplishments, he changed the face of higher education by enabling millions of low- and middle-income students to achieve the dream of a college education. Recognizes the federal Pell grants, the educational grants that bear his name, as a significant part of Senator Pell's legacy.
