	<summary>
	1/14/2009--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)<br/>Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 - Makes this Act's amendments effective on April 1, 2009, regardless of whether final regulations have been promulgated to carry them out.<br/>Allows certain state plans under titles XIX (Medicaid) or XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (SCHIP, referred to in this Act as CHIP) of the Social Security Act (SSA) that require state legislation to meet additional requirements imposed by this Act additional time to make required plan changes.<br/>Provides for coordination of CHIP funding for FY2009.<br/>Title I: Financing - Subtitle A: Funding - (Sec. 101) Amends SSA title XXI to reauthorize the CHIP program through FY2013 at increased levels. (Sec. 102) Provides for the determination of allotments for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the commonwealths and territories for FY2009-FY2013.<br/>(Sec. 103) Establishes in the Treasury the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund for payments to a state to eliminate its shortfall (the amount by which its available federal CHIP allotments are not adequate to cover its CHIP expenditures.)<br/>(Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a performance bonus payment to states to offset additional Medicaid and CHIP child enrollment costs resulting from enrollment and retention efforts. Limits the use of such payments to reducing the number of low-income children who do not have health insurance coverage in the state. Makes appropriations for FY2009 for such payments. Requires certain funds transfers to cover FY2009-FY2013. (Sec. 105) Reduces the availability of allotments for FY2009 and each ensuing fiscal year from three to two years.<br/>(Sec. 106) Amends SSA title XXI to require redistribution of unused allotments to states with funding shortfalls for fiscal years beginning with FY2007.<br/>Revises requirements for the redistribution of unused allotments for FY2006.<br/>(Sec. 107) Allows qualifying states the option to receive the enhanced portion of the CHIP matching rate for Medicaid (SSA title XIX) coverage of certain children.<br/>Repeals the March 31, 2009, termination date of (thus making permanent) the authority for a state to use certain funds to pay for medical assistance to individuals under age 19 whose family income exceeds 150% of the poverty line.<br/>(Sec. 108) Makes a one-time appropriation of additional funds to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for FY2013.<br/>(Sec. 109) Revises funding requirements for the territories under CHIP and SSA title XIX (Medicaid) for FY2009-FY2013.<br/>Removes federal matching payments for data reporting systems from the overall limit on payments to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.<br/>Directs the Comptroller General to report to the appropriate congressional committees on federal funding under Medicaid and CHIP for such territories.<br/>Subtitle B: Focus on Low-Income Children and Pregnant Women - (Sec. 111) Gives states the option to cover targeted low-income pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment if certain conditions are met, including that the state has established an income eligibility level of at least 185% of the federal poverty line for pregnant women under Medicaid. Sets the minimum income eligibility level for children under age 19 at 200% of the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved. Provides for automatic enrollment for children born to women receiving pregnancy-related assistance.<br/>(Sec. 112) Provides for phase-out of CHIP coverage for nonpregnant childless adults, leaving states an option to apply for a Medicaid waiver to continue coverage for such adults. Requires extension of an expiring waiver, at state request, but only through FY2011, and only for childless adults who were covered during FY2010. Prescribes terms and conditions for coverage of parents of targeted low-income children.<br/>Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on whether: (1) the coverage of a parent, a caretaker relative, or a legal guardian of a targeted low-income child under a state CHIP health plan increases the enrollment of, or the quality of care for, children; and (2) such parents, relatives, and legal guardians who enroll in such a plan are more likely to enroll their children in such a plan or in a state Medicaid plan.<br/>(Sec. 113) Eliminates counting Medicaid child presumptive eligibility costs against CHIP allotment.<br/>(Sec. 114) Limits the matching rate for states that propose to cover children with effective family income that exceeds 300% of the poverty line. Exempts from this denial (grandfathers) any state that already has an approved state plan amendment or waiver to provide such expenditures. (Sec. 115) Allows the Secretary, at state option, to provide the state with the federal medical assistance percentage determined for the state for Medicaid with respect to certain expenditures or otherwise made to provide medical assistance under Medicaid to a child who could be covered by the state under CHIP.<br/>Allows a state to cover: (1) certain individuals and thereby receive federal financial participation for medical assistance for them under Medicaid; or (2) receive such federal financial participation for children made eligible as a result of an income or resource eligibility level expansion.<br/>Title II: Outreach and Enrollment - Subtitle A: Outreach and Enrollment Activities - (Sec. 201) Amends SSA title XXI to direct the Secretary to award grants during FY2009-FY2013 for outreach and enrollment efforts to increase the enrollment and participation of eligible children under CHIP and Medicaid, particularly Native American beneficiaries.<br/>Makes necessary appropriations.<br/>Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a national enrollment campaign to improve the enrollment of underserved child populations in CHIP and Medicaid programs.<br/>Allows payments under CHIP and Medicaid for translation or interpreting services in connection with the enrollment of, retention of, and use of services by, individuals for whom English is not their primary language.<br/>(Sec. 202) Amends SSA title XI to provide for increased outreach and enrollment of Indians in CHIP and Medicaid.<br/>Waives the 10% cap on CHIP payments for outreach with respect to any expenditures for outreach activities to families of Indian children likely to be eligible for child health assistance under the state Medicaid plan or related waivers.<br/>(Sec. 203) Authorizes a state plan under the Medicaid and CHIP programs to rely on findings from an Express Lane agency to conduct simplified eligibility determinations.<br/>Amends SSA title XIX to authorize a federal or state agency or private entity in possession of the sources of data directly relevant for Medicaid eligibility determination (including eligibility files maintained by an Express Lane agency) to convey such information to the state Medicaid agency, if such conveyance meets specified requirements. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosure of such information.<br/>Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements necessary to permit a state that elects the Express Lane option to receive data directly relevant to determining eligibility and the correct amount of benefits under CHIP or Medicaid from: (1) the National Directory of New Hires; and (2) data regarding enrollment in insurance that may help to facilitate outreach and enrollment under the state Medicaid and CHIP plans and such other programs as the Secretary may specify.<br/>Subtitle B: Reducing Barriers to Enrollment - (Sec. 211) Gives states the option, as an alternative to the current documentation requirement, to verify a declaration of U.S. citizenship or nationality for purposes of Medicaid or CHIP eligibility through verification of a name and Social Security number with the Commissioner of Social Security.
