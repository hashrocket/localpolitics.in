Defines &quot;compensable Guam decedent&quot; as a Guam resident who died or was killed as a result of the attack and occupation of Guam by Japanese military forces during World War II, or incident to Guam's liberation by U.S. military forces, and whose death would have been compensable under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act of 1945 if a timely claim had been filed.
