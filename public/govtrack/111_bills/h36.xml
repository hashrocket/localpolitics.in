	1/7/2009--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<br/>Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2009 - Amends federal law regarding presidential archival depositories to require any presidential library fundraising organization to submit quarterly reports to the National Archives and Records Administration and specified congressional committees on every contributor who gave the organization a contribution or contributions (whether monetary or in-kind) totaling $200 or more for the quarterly period. Requires the Archivist of the United States to make such information available to the public through the Internet as soon as is practicable after each quarterly filing. Makes it unlawful for contributors or fundraising organizations to knowingly and willfully submit false information or omit material information. Prescribes criminal penalties for violation of such prohibitions.<br/>
