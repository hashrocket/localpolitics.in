	1/15/2009--Introduced.<br/>Economic Recovery Through Increased Feeding Act of 2009 - Amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (the Food Stamp Act of 1977 as renamed by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008) to increase to 12 months the amount of time certain work capable adults can receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (formerly, food stamp benefits).

Increases funding for grants to increase program participation. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to support the use of electronic benefits transfers for federal nutrition programs at farmers' markets.
