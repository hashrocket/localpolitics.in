	1/15/2009--Introduced.<br/>Fix Housing First Homebuyer Tax Credit Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the tax credit for first-time homebuyers by: (1) eliminating the first-time homebuyer requirement (thus making such credit available to all homebuyers); (2) eliminating the repayment requirement for such credit except for resales of a principal residence, or failure to occupy such residence, at any time within three years of purchase; (3) exempting from the repayment requirement members of the Armed Forces who are ordered to relocate; (4) extending the period for purchasing a residence until December 31, 2009; (5) allowing taxpayers who purchase a residence before 2010 to claim such credit on either their 2008 or 2009 tax returns; (6) increasing the maximum amount of such credit and the adjusted gross income thresholds for reductions in the credit amount; (7) allowing taxpayers to transfer their anticipated credit amount to another individual for specified purposes, including making a downpayment on a portion of a purchase price of a principal residence; and (8) extending eligibility for the credit to taxpayers who purchase residences financed with state and local tax-exempt bonds.<br/>
